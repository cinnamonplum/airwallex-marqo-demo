Tell us a little about yourself, and what attracted you to join Airwallex?Being based in Lithuania, I have witnessed the growth and development of the country as an international hub for startups. I began my career working in banks, before making the transition into fintech a few years ago, when I realised the impact fintech is having towards transforming the financial landscape. I joined Airwallex back in September 2021, at a time when the company was really ramping up its regional expansion across EMEA. Its international footprint, strong global ambitions and high-growth potential, alongside its focus on enabling a seamless customer journey, were what attracted me to join. I also knew I wanted to expand my skill set, take on a new challenge and make an impact.2. Why is Lithuania such an important market for our business?Lithuania may be a small country, but little do people know that it is in fact, the largest fintech hub in the EU in terms of licensed companies. It is an incredibly dynamic place. For starters, the Lithuanian regulators are very forward-looking and have adapted legislation to support innovation in the fintech ecosystem. We were also fortunate to work alongside the Bank of Lithuania to secure our EMI licence in October 2021, enabling us to grow our business in the region.Lithuanians are incredibly energetic and motivated in their personal and professional lives, and this alone will drive greater innovation and talent in the market. 3. Can you tell us a little about Airwallex’s presence in Lithuania?We started providing full services earlier this year, on 26 July 2022 and launched our service centre (operations hub) for our EMEA operations back in January 2022. We also have an established office, with a team of over 15 employees on the ground. We will continue to strengthen our local operations so we can better support local businesses in Lithuania going forward. By the end of the year, we aim to have over 20 employees, with plans to grow the team even more in 2023.4. It has been a challenging few years for businesses, with the volatile macroeconomic conditions and ongoing covid pandemic. Has this impacted your growth in Lithuania?The last few years have certainly been challenging for many. As a group, we are fortunate to have continued to support businesses during these challenging times. In Lithuania, keeping pace with Airwallex’s global growth, we have successfully established our operations here, driven by the deep local talent pool and favourable regulatory environment.5. What types of companies do we work with in Lithuania? We are always on the lookout to support modern businesses - those who are tech-enabled and whom we can further support with our world-class global payments infrastructure. This includes businesses across a number of industries including ecommerce, travel, logistics and more.6. What's next for the Lithuania team? To better serve local businesses in Lithuania, we will prioritise hiring in the region. We will also continue to develop our global payment infrastructure and offer unique payment solutions to Lithuania and other European countries' customers. In parallel, we will also bolster our service centre by providing additional services such as customer support, onboarding, and transaction monitoring from Lithuania to further support our other entities in EMEA.To find out more about Airwallex’s Lithuania business, please contact Virgilijus Mirkes directly at [email protected].

This was back in 2019 when I was working in Shanghai. I moved to Amsterdam just weeks before Covid hit. Fast forward to 2021, Airwallex was expanding the commercial team in EMEA, and I was looking to dive back into an earlier stage of growing a business. I was drawn to the breadth of products and global mission of Airwallex.  Having the opportunity to work with such a diverse group of people means I’m constantly learning and solving for new challenges.
What made you decide to move to Amsterdam? My partner (now recently husband) was on a work assignment to Amsterdam from New York, where we first met. Instead of moving back to the US, we decided to reunite in Amsterdam.  We’re grateful to be able to embrace the Dutch culture and explore different countries in Europe!You started your career working in a bank - what made you decide to make the switch to fintech? Fintech is a competitive space, but at the same time there is a lot of potential for companies to drive innovation together. While I learned a great deal from my first job in finance, I was motivated by the opportunity to work in a high-growth environment. I spent the last several years working in various commercial roles at Yext, an enterprise SaaS company. Making the transition to fintech requires constant learning, but it’s what keeps my role interesting.What I find unique about the Airwallex platform is that it’s modular. It allows us to be flexible in working with partners - helping them build their foundation, launch new products, and scale over time.How can we encourage more women and diversity in technology?Having the representation of women and diversity in leadership has helped shape the dynamic within Airwallex and how we’re able to attract talent. For me, having a diverse set of mentors has greatly contributed to my sense of belonging at the company. It’s not something I take for granted. We’re solving complex problems for customers who operate globally - I think the different perspectives and skill sets we have as a team are what empowers us to tackle those challenges.We all have a role to play in encouraging more diversity in technology. I used to think you need to be super experienced to mentor others. Over time, I realized some of the most actionable advice came from people who were just a few years my senior and could relate to me from recent experience. This prompted me to volunteer as a mentor at an external Women in Tech organization. Wherever you are in your career journey, you can support others in the same way you wish to be supported.
You work with a very global team. How do you make it work, and how are you able to effectively manage a global team?I’m on the strategic partnerships team and we’re spread across Europe, Asia, and the US. It’s not sustainable to have calls with all members frequently. We have a strong written culture which allows us to work asynchronously as much as possible. Earlier this year, our team met for the first time in Singapore. The rapport we were able to build in person really helped us drive openness and push each other to do our best work.Outside of work, what is something that you enjoy doing?Running and hiking are some of my favorite hobbies. I find that being outdoors is the best way to unwind and recharge. Since moving to Europe, my husband and I started an annual tradition of doing multi-day treks and were lucky enough to hike the Tour of Mont Blanc, Laugavegur in Iceland and most recently Slovenia. Next year, we’ve got our sights set on the Dolomites in Italy!
What’s one thing you wish you had known when you first started your career?Being different - whether in gender, ethnicity, background, or sometimes being the “only” - is an opportunity for both yourself and your team.When I first started my career, I focused so much on assimilating. Channel that energy into finding the niche you can fill. Understanding the unique value you carry will help you pitch yourself for more opportunities. Your difference can ultimately be your superpower - don’t diminish it!Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/funnels-vs-flywheels,Funnels vs Flywheels: The Secret to Driving Exponential Growth,"BlogFunnels vs Flywheels: The Secret to Driving Exponential Growth20 October 2022•6 minBusiness tipsFinanceIn this article•What are funnels and flywheels? •Limitations of the classic sales and marketing funnel•How to build a successful flywheel•Examples of flywheels in business•Grow your business with Airwallex Funnels vs Flywheels: The Secret to Driving Exponential GrowthWhen you compare the funnel and flywheel model, you’ll notice a major difference.The marketing and sales funnel aims to convert leads into paying customers, while the flywheel focuses on converting and retaining them. Essentially, the flywheel approach is a more customer-centric marketing strategy. The ideal flywheel should increase customer retention and turn your loyal customers into promoters.In the past, traditional sales funnels formed the basis for the standard customer journey. But things have changed. A flywheel business model has proven to be much more lucrative for modern businesses.Why? Because the flywheel sustains itself.  Let’s take a closer look at how the funnel and flywheel work.  What are funnels and flywheels? Funnels and flywheels are ways to visualise and understand your customer journey. In some cases, funnels and flywheels are there without your business consciously putting them into practice. Once you thoroughly understand the two approaches and their benefits, you can use them to scale your own business.What’s a funnel? A funnel is a system that focuses primarily on sales and marketing. It helps you picture each customer’s journey. There are typically three parts of a sales and marketing funnel: the top, middle and bottom.The further down a customer gets in your funnel, the closer they are to making a purchase. Let’s look into the different sales and marketing funnel stages.Top of the funnel (TOFU)People at the top of the funnel (TOFU) are new to your business. They may have heard of you, visited your website or perhaps engaged in your social media posts, but they haven’t yet made a purchase from you. Top-funnel customers may have a problem or something missing in their lives, and they’re looking for ways to fix or fill it. The solutions your business provides may be exactly what they’re looking for. But before they make a purchase from you, they need to go through the conversion funnel. The conversion funnel leads them to the middle funnel and then the bottom funnel. At the bottom funnel, they purchase. Here are some conversion types you can optimise to move people from your top funnel to the middle or bottom funnel:1. Completing a registration process.2. Subscribing to your newsletter.3. Booking a call. 4. Downloading software applications or gated content from your website.Middle of the funnel (MOFU)The middle of the funnel (MOFU) is where you’ll find your qualified leads. These leads might have subscribed to your newsletter, downloaded a piece of content, or signed up/registered for an account via your website. While you have basic information about them, such as their email address, name and product interests, you need to dig deeper. When you learn more, you can push them through the conversion funnel into your bottom funnel. Here are some conversion methods you can use for customers in your middle funnel:1. Engagement. Increase the number of opened emails, social engagements and viewed content posts.2. Segmentation. Separate leads into different categories based on their behaviours, and take next steps tailored to each category.3. Activation. Foster a responsible and positive relationship between your business and your customer leads. You could invite them to attend an event, or offer them an additional piece of free content to encourage engagement.Bottom of the funnel (BOFU)While the bottom of the funnel (BOFU) holds the smallest pool of potential customers, it’s by far the most rewarding field when it comes to turning leads into customers. BOFU leads need a little bit of a nudge to make a purchase. Here are some incentives to consider to push BOFU leads through the customer conversion funnel: 1. A special time-restricted offer.2. A small discount for making a first purchase.3. Sharing reviews from delighted customers.4. Talking to a customer directly and offering product reassurance. What’s a flywheel?In the marketing funnel model, you make efforts to attract customer prospects and then convert them to purchasing customers. However, in the flywheel business model, you put ongoing effort into the customer journey by making initial and repeat purchases easier and more satisfying. A key aspect of the flywheel is that it keeps spinning. Compared to a funnel, where customers pour in and come out, the flywheel keeps customers circling. The flywheel business model is more effective and leads to greater profits because it prioritises the customer — they’re the centre of focus. Limitations of the classic sales and marketing funnelThe classic sales funnel is limited by design. A marketing team will do their job and attract qualified leads. Then, a sales team will work to convert those leads into paying customers. The customer then falls out of the funnel, and the customer journey is over. This constant downward push is flawed because the end goal is a purchase rather than ongoing customer success. A significant amount of money usually goes into attracting new leads. Then, more money goes into converting a customer through sales. Does any money go into retaining customers? With a classic sales and marketing funnel, the answer is no. The funnel’s biggest limitation is that resources go to waste. You spend both time and money moving a customer from prospect to purchase, but you ultimately waste those resources if you fail to generate repeat sales.Turning new customers into repeat customers is one of the most effective ways to increase your profits. And the best way to do that is following the flywheel business model. The classic sales funnel no longer meets modern customers’ needs nor promotes team collaboration. With a classic sales and marketing funnel, your marketing team’s efforts are very much separate from your sales team’s efforts. With a flywheel, collaboration is vital to increase the chances of customer success. How to build a successful flywheelBefore you build a successful flywheel, start thinking of it as FUN (focused on user needs). Your flywheel should provide specific actions for the different steps in a customer’s journey. This key aspect is similar to a funnel, but funnels and flywheels have different steps. The steps in a sales funnel are to attract, engage and convert. But the steps in a flywheel are to attract, engage and delight. Delighting customers is what sets a flywheel business model apart from a funnel. Because customer satisfaction is of top priority in a flywheel, customers are likely to return and make repeat purchases. Funnels focus on conversion rather than customer success, which leads to fewer repeat purchases. What’s more, happy customers usually multiply. Customers who enjoy their shopping and purchase experience often notify others about it via word of mouth. They’re also more likely to leave reviews, and when prospective customers read those positive reviews, they’re more likely to make a first purchase or come back as a repeat customer. So, to build a successful flywheel, you should encourage customers to leave positive reviews after making a purchase. Try sending out emails or creating review submission options after customers check out (or a certain period of time after a purchase is made). You should also focus on ways to remove friction from your internal processes. This will make your flywheel spin faster. The amount of momentum in your flywheel depends on three factors: How big it is.How fast it spins.How much friction it has.The most successful businesses will address each factor when developing their flywheel business model. Your flywheel’s speed will increase when you add force to the areas that influence your business most. Adding force could mean implementing certain strategies or programmes to those large-impact areas. Here some examples to improve your flywheel effect in business:Customer referral program. Newsletters.Freemium model. Inbound marketing. Investment in your customer service team.Easier payment checkouts.💡Top tip: According to research from PPRO, 20% of global cart abandonments are due to a lack of local payment methods on merchant checkouts.  You can solve this problem by plugging Airwallex into your online store. With Airwallex Online Payments, you can accept payment in multiple currencies via 60+ local payment methods, and create a frictionless checkout experience for your global customers.  Examples of flywheels in businessOne of the most successful companies to use the flywheel business model is Amazon. In fact, it was Jeff Bezos who first pioneered the flywheel model on the advice of former Stanford professor Jim Collins. When it comes to the flywheel, Amazon has the method down pat. Here’s how the Amazon flywheel works:The number-one principle for all Amazon employees is customer experience.A superb customer experience drives further traffic to Amazon.com, more sales and more reviews.Due to increased site traffic, sellers are encouraged to list products on Amazon.com.More sellers listing their products leads to greater selection for customers.Lower cost structure and emphasis on positive customer experience increase traffic onAmazon.com and lead to repeat sales and greater profits. Using this approach, Amazon experienced (and continues to experience) major growth. The company uses the flywheel principle for all its go-to-market projects to accelerate growth. In recent years, the flywheel model has resurfaced and gained traction amongst marketing professionals, due in part to its adoption and promotion by Hubspot under the direction of CEO Brian Halligan. [Related: What eCommerce businesses need to know about Amazon Pay]Grow your business with Airwallex You can build a better checkout experience into your flywheel today, and reach thousands of new customers with a Global Business Account from Airwallex.Plug our Online Payments software into your eCommerce store to reduce friction at your checkout and attract more customers globally. Our simple plug-and-play solution integrates with leading platforms including Shopify, Magento and WooCommerce, allowing your global customers to pay you in their preferred currency via their favourite payment method - whether that’s Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Alipay, WeChat Pay or any of our 60+ options.   Plus, our market-beating foreign exchange (FX) rates mean you can pass savings onto your customers and beat your competitors on price. Less friction, more global sales, more repeat purchases. Sign up today to get started.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/sustainability-vs-profit,Can your business be sustainable and chase profits?,"BlogCan your business be sustainable and chase profits?19 October 2022•5 minBusiness tipsIn this article•What is sustainable business?•Why become a sustainable business?•How can you reduce your environmental impact?•Planet vs profit: Does it have to be a choice?•Take your business global with AirwallexMaking an effort to do business more sustainably is vital to the long-term future of your business and the planet.  In this article, we’ll take a look at what makes a business sustainable, helpful sustainable business ideas that your company can pursue and ways to enact your sustainable business strategy. What is sustainable business?So, what is sustainable business?Sustainable business is the concept and practice of doing business without making a negative impact on the community, the environment and society. The main goal of your sustainable business strategy should be to make a positive impact on those areas, or at least one of them. When a company doesn’t recognise that its operations have an effect on more than itself, it fails to take responsibility for the social inequalities, environmental degradation and climate change it causes. That’s why increasingly, business leaders are looking to build corporate social responsibility into their business operations and company culture.So, if your company wants to create a sustainable business model, you need to consider how short-term profits may lead to long-term liabilities..Examples of sustainability in businessThe sustainable business strategy or strategies your company chooses to participate in will be unique to your organisational values and goals. Here are some sustainable business initiatives you can start thinking about:Use eco-friendly materials in your manufacturing, assembling and/or shipping processes to reduce carbon emissions. Use clean energy from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, to power your facilities and lower your carbon footprint. Sponsor local organisations related to education, housing and marginalised communities. [Related: Profit margins: 5 things every startup founder needs to know]Why become a sustainable business?So, why should you strive to become a sustainable business? Well, apart from anything else, sustainability initiatives can actually drive financial success.Investors look at key business metrics to determine whether a company is worth their investment. But increasingly, investors are also looking at environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics to decide how much of an impact a company makes with its eco-friendly practices. Why? High ESG ratings have lower debt and equity costs, according to research. Additionally, more than one third of customers are willing to pay more when buying from sustainable businesses. Consumers are more regularly looking at your carbon emissions, water usage, employee and board diversity, and how the organisation contributes to its community.  One example of a business which takes environmental sustainability seriously is Ikea. It achieves sustainability through both its operations and supply chain efforts. Here are some top eco-friendly standouts from Ikea’s sustainable practices in business:It sources about half of its wood from sustainable forests.It adheres to cotton standards that minimise water pollution.It sources renewable energy from solar panels (with plans to sell them in the UK and other countries).More and more consumers are paying attention to whether their favourite brands are certified as Benefit Corporations (more commonly referred to as B Corp). A B Corp certification represents your company’s dedication to meeting high standards in accountability, supply chain practices, input material, employee benefits and more. To earn a B Corp certification, your company needs to:Achieve a B Impact Assessment score of 80 or above and pass a risk review to prove your high social and environmental performance.Legally change your company’s corporate governance structure so that all stakeholders — not just shareholders — are held accountable for its practices. Allow performance information to be measured against B Lab’s standards, and have it publicly available on your B Corp profile and B Lab’s website.  So, sustainable practices in business actually pay off, and a sustainable business model also fosters new growth opportunities. You can meet customer expectations in terms of corporate sustainability while also providing quality products and services.Essentially, you can do well financially by doing good environmentally. There is an overlap between chasing profit and being sustainable.Let’s explore some ways you can reduce your environmental impact.How can you reduce your environmental impact?You can create a more sustainable business model in several ways. Let’s go over some strategies.1. Analyse your problems and brainstorm objectivesThe first way to spark change in your business is to define what sustainability means for your company, team, clients and overall industry. Once you’ve defined the overarching problem areas that each group recognises, you can analyse those problems. Then, you can define objectives for how to make lasting changes.Consider asking these questions to determine what each group sees as a priority:Is our business attracting diverse talent?Do we have an inclusive business culture?How much waste is our business creating?Are we making a negative or positive impact on the community?Are we sponsoring any local community or environmentally focused organisations?Are we doing everything we can to cut down greenhouse gas emissions in our supply chain? Could we use more sustainable materials and carbon neutral suppliers?Once you know the answers, your business can start creating inclusive and eco-friendly sustainability objectives. You can also take the SMART goals approach. This approach refers to setting goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (aka SMART!). The SMART approach helps you create goals that you’re highly likely to meet. This is because the goals you brainstorm through the SMART method are realistic and allow you to create manageable objectives that set you up for success. [Related:Attract, develop, retain: Top talent to transform your business with Naomi Simson]2. Create your sustainable business strategyNow that you have a focused mission statement, you can start aligning your processes toward creating a sustainable business model foundation.As stated earlier, your company can do well financially if it does good environmentally. But to ensure your business is sustainable while chasing profits, you need to zero in and tailor how you manufacture, market and deliver your unique offerings. And as a friendly reminder, taking the right eco-friendly steps may spark further profitability rather than hinder it.If you consider the triple bottom line — or how your business’s actions affect profit, people and the planet — you can develop a sustainable business strategy that's not only environmentally friendly but also profitable.A great strategy to follow is starting small. After all, small changes add up and eventually lead to big shifts. Try incorporating eco-conscious office rules, such as overhead lights that automatically turn off at 9 pm to save on energy consumption. Or initiate a recycling program at your company if one doesn’t already exist. Perhaps you could offer an incentive (such as free lunch or a coffee shop gift card) for employees to take public transit, carpool or commute via bicycling or walking. You can change external as well as internal strategies.A Unilever study found 33% of customers want to purchase from brands that are environmentally friendly and produce sustainable goods.Improving your marketing efforts will make the public aware of what you're up to. Your current customer base and leads will know that your business is actively trying to provide sustainable products and services — this goes a long way when attracting new customers and leads. But before you implement your strategy, consider some additional questions:“Will our existing customers pay a higher price if we produce our product more sustainably?” Think about placing a survey in your next newsletter to find the answer. “Can we scale, grow and enhance our operations while also reducing our carbon emissions?” Consider consulting an energy professional to examine your goals and current energy usage to determine whether that’s possible. Your answers to these questions are the first steps to enacting your sustainable business model.4. Implement your sustainable business strategy and analyse the resultsWith your mission statement and strategy laid out, you can now move to achieve your objectives and goals. One way to do this is by joining the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The WBCSD is a global, CEO-led community with more than 200 sustainable businesses that work together to speed the transformations needed to become nature positive and net zero. It does this by engaging sustainability leaders, decision-makers and executives to express their unique insights and obstacles they’ve dealt with.So when you implement your strategy, ensure your problem areas remain aligned with your goals, objectives, mission statement, strategy and progress. And if you want to see more immediate results, you can ask yourself what areas will make a quick difference and fuel your long-haul objectives.Consider partnering with local community-based organisations or with a business at your size to boost your credibility in the nature-positive corporate realm. [Related:4 Habits of highly successful eCommerce businesses]Planet vs profit: Does it have to be a choice?Now that you have an idea of how to turn your purpose into performance, you can put your sustainable business management goals into practice.When you start meeting your objectives and accomplishing small goals along the way, you’ll find new ways to make a larger impact in a shorter time. But every business needs to start somewhere.If results aren’t immediately apparent, not to worry. You can try different approaches to your sustainable business strategy until you find the one that works best for your company and team.And remember — doing good by the planet and chasing profit aren’t mutually exclusive. You can do both.Take your business global with AirwallexIf you’re looking to streamline your finances and expand your business, contact Airwallex. Our Global Business Accounts allow businesses of all sizes, including fast-growing startups, to open 11 foreign currency accounts at the click of a button.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-accountants-can-support-ecommerce-clients-q4,How accountants can support eCommerce clients in Q4 and beyond,"BlogHow accountants can support eCommerce clients in Q4 and beyondTilly Michell17 October 2022•5 minutesE-commercePartner StoryIn this article•Fail to prepare, prepare to fail•Guiding clients towards global success  •Implementing industry-specific financial infrastructure•The business account built for eCommerceIt’s the most wonderful time of the year, as the old song goes. And it’s a particularly wonderful time for eCommerce businesses, with Q4 sales totalling USD257.62 billion in the US alone in 2021 at a growth rate of 9.2% YOY. But with steep targets, tough competition and ever-changing logistical challenges, this is also a stressful time of year. What can accountants do to alleviate some of that stress and steer their clients towards success in Q4 and beyond? We sat down with Darren Buckley, Founder and Managing Director at Finzo, to find out. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail
There are various global factors that have made planning for Q4 success more of a challenge in 2022. One of them is currency volatility. For eCommerce businesses with international suppliers and/or customers, instability in the forex market can have a serious impact on profit margin. To mitigate the risk, Darren recommends his clients use a multi-currency account, such as Airwallex, to hedge against currency fluctuations.    “It comes back to having that control over how and when you convert currencies,” says Darren. “As opposed to using a system where payments are auto-converted and losing quite a bit depending on the volume of transactions.”  Another challenge comes from supply chain disruption caused by global headwinds including the price of fuel, worker strikes and rising freight container costs.  “Q4 is all about demand and being able to service that demand,” says Darren. “I think it’s about how businesses are planning ahead as opposed to being reactive. We have some clients who have been a bit more forward-thinking and invested in their manufacturing cycles and getting their stock in place, and they’re well prepared now. Not all businesses in the current climate have the cash flow to support that, but some have been lucky.”Guiding clients towards global success  Despite the challenges, the opportunity for eCommerce businesses in today's market is huge, with annual global sales projected to reach USD7.4 trillion by 2025. What makes that figure particularly exciting for ambitious entrepreneurs is the rise in cross-border shopping, which has opened up the growth potential of eCommerce businesses beyond their domestic market. An eCommerce business can now expand into the world’s fastest-growing markets without ever getting on a plane. According to Darren, the opportunity here is twofold. eCommerce businesses can reach millions of new customers by scaling abroad and open themselves up to interest from international investors.  “What I’m finding at the minute is that the UK market is extremely anxious,” says Darren. “Whereas if you look at the US and Canada VCs, they are still looking to invest in businesses with strong trade links to other markets overseas.”    [Related: The top cross-border eCommerce markets businesses should expand into in 2022 and beyond] Implementing industry-specific financial infrastructureAccountants play a crucial role in building the financial infrastructure that enables eCommerce businesses to manage transactions across multiple currencies, platforms and countries. This is not always an easy feat. Whilst some clients are fully onboard with the latest tech from day one, others may need some coaching. “For us it’s been about shifting our clients’ mindset away from this old-school way of accounting and introducing them to various levels of technology that can provide that finger-on-the-pulse relationship between us and them,” says Darren. “Then we allow ourselves to guide them through going into new markets and ensuring they’re making the right decisions.” Darren stresses the importance of using industry-specific technology to better serve clients. With the right software in place, eCommerce businesses can step away from manual processes and spend more time on growth. “We’re not your standard Xero and Quickbooks firm,” says Darren. “We have many finance applications which we use. When we source these products we look at the wider integrations, the wider App Marketplace, to see what else we can bring in to help these clients on an operational level. We look at where ops and finance overlap.” As an example of how the right technology can enable growth, Darren points to a client that has recently launched on a popular consumer platform in the US. The platform exists on the US app store and business owners need a local US foreign currency account to access it. Using Airwallex, Darren’s client was able to set up a US domiciled foreign currency account from the UK at the click of a button. “You wouldn’t be able to do that with a high street bank,” he says.The business account built for eCommerceAirwallex provides financial infrastructure for high-growth eCommerce businesses. Open 11 foreign currency accounts for free at the click of a button and collect, hold and spend in multiple currencies without high fees or forced currency conversions.“If you have even a small bit of overseas expenditure, get Airwallex, it’s a no-brainer,” says Darren. “Being able to open a foreign currency account in many jurisdictions within seconds is so useful. Being able to hold a currency, for example, in USD and keep it in USD for future spend is great. It gives the business owner control over their finances. And given the market at the minute, being able to make a hedged bet when it comes to currency conversions is useful.”Airwallex also offers Online Payments technology, multi-currency cards, and expense management, allowing eCommerce businesses to manage their entire financial ecosystem in a single platform. For more information on how Airwallex can help you support your eCommerce clients, sign up for a free Airwallex account.

We’ll also cover how to value your startup, how much to ask investors for and the common mistakes to avoid. Plus, we’ll speak to industry experts to get their first hand tips on how to prepare the perfect pitch. Types of funding available to startupsFirst things first. Before you start raising capital, you need to choose the funding avenues that are right for your business. Here are the funding types that may be available to you. Personal capital Founders often use their own savings or rely on money from family and friends to kick start their business in the pre-seed stage. This is sometimes called “bootstrapping”.Be aware, there are risks here. 60% of startups fail within their first three years, and you might not be able to recover your personal savings, or that of your family and friends, if your business unravels. But if you have confidence in your idea and are in a position where you can afford to take a risk, using personal capital can help take your business from an idea sketched on the back of a napkin to something more tangible that future investors will want to get onboard with.  CrowdfundingCrowdfunding is the process of persuading a large amount of people to invest a small amount of capital in your business. Rather than convincing one individual to invest USD500,000 into your startup, you can try persuading 5,000 people to invest USD100. The idea is that no one is putting a large amount of capital at risk.  Social media and crowdfunding websites give founders access to a wide range of potential investors. These investors are usually ordinary people who might decide to support your business in return for rewards, equity, or simply because they like your idea and want to be a part of it.  In order to protect vulnerable people, there are some legal restrictions on who can contribute to crowdfunds and how much.  [Related: Venture capital vs crowdfunding: What’s the best call for your business?]
Incubators and Accelerators Incubators and Accelerators provide a range of support services to young businesses, including office space, workshops, access to professional services at a reduced rate, and seed funding. In return, they will typically ask for equity in your company.  Incubators can be academic organisations (such as universities), non-profit organisations, commercial companies, or venture capital firms. Accelerators will typically operate as part of a scheme which is backed by the government or by a corporate company. Angel investorsAn angel investor is an individual who invests a large amount of their own capital into a startup or small business in return for ownership equity. Angel investors tend to be wealthy individuals with business experience who, as well as offering funding, also offer mentorship to entrepreneurs and access to a network of useful contacts.  Angel investors differ from venture capitalists in that they invest in the earliest stages of a business, even though this puts their capital at considerable risk. Angels may take those risks because they want a business to succeed for personal reasons, not just for profit. An angel investor might be a friend, or someone who strongly believes in what your business is trying to achieve. Angel investors will typically ask for a 20 - 25% stake in your business, which is why this form of investment is usually confined to seed-stage businesses that cannot access funding from other sources, such as investment banks.  Venture capitalVenture capital is a type of private equity given to startups with long-term growth potential. Unlike angel investors, who invest personal wealth into startups, venture capitalists typically work for financial institutions such as investment banks and venture capital firms. Venture capitalists take money from accredited investors and put it into promising early-stage enterprises in exchange for equity. The overall objective of any venture capitalist is to generate profit for their investors. The upside of venture capital is that you can secure funding for your business even if you do not have assets or cash flow. The downside is that venture capitalists may demand a large stake in your company, and even require you to relinquish some control over the direction of the business.   Debt: Business loans, credit cards and moreThere are a number of funding options available to businesses looking to take on debt, and each has their own eligibility criteria. Some avenues to consider are business loans, invoice finance, government loan schemes, credit cards and asset finance. This type of finance comes from banks, peer-to-peer lending corporations and commercial lenders. Interest rates vary depending on the type of finance and the provider, so it’s worth thoroughly researching the options before committing to a product. Often, the lender will require security such as a personal guarantee before agreeing to loan you money. This means you may have to secure the debt against your house or your business assets. Only businesses that have cash flow, and are therefore able to pay back the interest accrued on their debt, should consider taking on this type of finance. Private equityAs the name suggests, private equity is a type of financing reserved for businesses that are not yet publicly trading on the stock exchange.Unlike venture capitalists, private equity firms do not invest in early-stage startups. This is a form of investment that you should consider later down the line, for example in your Series B funding round. Startup fundraising stages Pre-seed Pre-seed funding is the first round of capital that founders raise to get their business off the ground. The amount raised in a pre-seed funding round usually totals USD50 - USD250k. You should use this initial investment for:Market research: to validate your business model and product idea.Prototypes: a version of your product which you can show to potential investors and stakeholders. Patents and licensing: to protect your intellectual property rights and ensure you’re legally allowed to distribute your product.   Hiring: you may need employees to get your business idea off the ground. Pre-seed funding typically comes from founders’ personal savings, as well as from family and friends. SeedSeed funding is the first round of capital that an early-stage business raises from investors. Seed funding amounts vary between USD10,000 - USD2 million. The amount you raise will depend on what you are trying to achieve at this stage in your business’ development.  You should use the money raised to continue the work you’ve begun in the pre-seed stage and develop a minimum viable product which is ready to take to market. Some companies will never need further investment beyond the seed funding stage. Others will need to continue raising money in order to achieve long-term growth and profitability. Series ATo successfully raise Series A funding, you need to show investors that you have a strategy for long-term profitability. Seed A funding typically comes from venture capitalists that will be looking for proof that your business is going to generate returns. Although it’s worth noting that venture capital is not the only route to Series A financing, crowdfunding is another option for businesses that fail to gain interest from venture capital firms. Less than 10% of seed-stage companies will go on to raise Series A funding. So how do you give your business the best chance of success?Approach investors because you’re ready for your next stage of growth, not because you’ve run out of money. Remember, raising capital takes time, so ideally you want to have a runway of 6 - 12 months before you start the process.    Make sure you get in front of the right people. Build a list of venture capital firms that have invested in companies similar to yours. These firms are more likely to be interested in your proposition.Build relationships by attending events. Make connections with peers who can introduce you to their investor network. Cold emails are likely to be ignored by venture capitalists, but a recommendation from a trusted contact will get you far.      When it comes to pitching, you must provide evidence that you have reached product market fit, are on top of your unit economics and have a plan for scaling your business towards profitability. At this stage, having a great idea is not enough, you need to show that your company is on track for long-term growth.  
Eran Galperin is the founder of Gymdesk, his advice to businesses seeking funding is to find a network of investors that suit your enterprise. “Find a network that shares similar philosophies to yours. It's no use pitching or moulding your company to fit the money. It has to be a hand-in-glove arrangement in order to maximise your chances of success and sustained growth.”If your pitch impresses a venture capitalist, they will carry out due diligence to check that your financial projections make sense and perform a valuation of your company to determine how much it will be worth in a given timeframe.Successful Series A funding rounds will raise between USD2 million and USD15 million. In the US, the average amount raised in a Series A funding round in 2021 was USD13 million, although this number was inflated by the high valuation of companies in the tech industry. In return for Series A funding, you can expect to give up between 20 - 25% of your company in the form of common or preferred stock. The investor will also expect to be involved in company proceedings going forward, and will likely request a seat on your board. You should use the money raised in your Series A funding round to progress towards your long-term growth goals. Series BAt this stage in your fundraising journey, your business should be well established with a proven business model. Part of your Series B funding may come from the same investors that provided capital during your Series A round. You can also pursue new avenues such as later-stage venture capitalist firms who are more likely to be interested in your business now that it has matured. Series C funding and beyondIf you’re looking into Series C funding, your business must be enjoying some success. At this stage, you may be looking for funding to support global expansion, develop new products or acquire a competitor.As you progress in your funding lifecycle, the balance of risk versus opportunity begins to tip in your favour, making it easier to get investors onboard. At this stage private equity firms, hedge funds and investment banks are likely to become interested in your company.[Related: From Seed to Series E: Understanding funding rounds]How to pitch to an investorOnce you’ve secured a meeting with an investor, it all comes down to your pitch. We spoke to some industry experts to find out how founders can best impress potential investors.Jason Porter is a Senior Investment Manager at Scottish Heritage SG. His advice is to play to your strengths and keep your proposed solution clear. “Investors will believe in your potential to thrive if you have a strong track record as a founder,” says Jason. “If not, you'll have to demonstrate your worth in other ways. Be honest and true to yourself. Investors are interested in your journey, how you reached your current position, and what motivated you to achieve your goals.”Jason stresses the importance of demonstrating your startup’s ability to address a market need or problem.  “If your brand is well-known and has a strong personality, but you are unclear about the solutions you are providing to the market, it is unlikely that you will be able to attract investors or secure enough cash,” he says. Sophia Jones works as an Investment Analyst at PiggyBank. Her advice is to make sure you have a clear understanding of what you're trying to accomplish and how you plan on doing it. “It's important to be able to explain your goals in a way that makes sense to investors who may not be familiar with your industry or technology,” says Sophia. “Create a realistic budget for what you want to accomplish with your funds. Investors want to know that you can use their money wisely and effectively. Finally, if possible, find early adopters for your product or service. This will help demonstrate that there is demand for what you're doing and provide some proof of concept for future investors.”Diego Kafie is the CEO and co-founder of Playbite, a mobile games platform backed by prominent venture capitalists like M25. His advice is to prepare.  “Prepare your pitch, prepare your answers. Prepare to be rejected countless times, and sometimes even get strung along for a while to no fruition,” says Diego. “Prepare to course correct: you'll learn from every meeting, and should apply those learnings to your pitch. Prepare to have to make tough calls as you inevitably have to pass on investors.”[Related: 10 key business metrics every startup founder needs to know]Valuing your startupValuation is an essential part of a startup fundraising strategy. There are several ways to do it. Here are some options: Comparable analysisThis valuation method, sometimes called peer group analysis or “comps”, involves finding companies that are similar to yours and looking at how they are valued by the market. The multiples that analysts use when performing comparable analysis vary by industry, but typically include: Enterprise value/sales (EV/S)Price/earnings (P/E)Enterprise value/earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation (EV/EBITDA)Price/book (P/B)The only drawback of this valuation method is that, for early-stage startups, it can be difficult to find companies that are comparable.    Discounted cash flow (DCF)This valuation method looks at the future earning potential of a company in order to determine how much an investment will be worth.The DCF method takes a company’s forecasted cash flow over a set period of time, then uses a discount rate — usually weighted average cost of capital (WACC) — to determine the present value of that cash flow. Investors can then gauge whether the value of their investment over time will be higher than the initial cost of the investment. Cost to duplicateTo work out your cost to duplicate, you need to calculate how much it would cost to build your business again from scratch. To do this, you need to look at how much you have spent to date on costs like equipment, product development and research.Cost to duplicate gives a fair valuation of your business’ current assets, but it doesn’t take into account your company’s future earning potential. For this reason, it is not the best valuation method for companies looking to persuade investors of their growth potential. 
How much funding should you ask for?There are a few things to consider before deciding how much capital to ask for in each funding round.1. Your company valuation
Understanding your company’s valuation is crucial to understanding how much capital you should ask investors for. Investors are looking to make returns between 10 - 40 times their investment amount, so by analysing your company’s future worth, you can work backwards to see how much you should ask for in exchange for the equity you’re offering.
2. How much equity you are prepared to give away 
The more money you ask for, the more equity an investor will require in order to earn returns. Be careful not to give away too much of your company in the early stages.
3. The amount each investor is looking to offer 
Angel investors typically invest between USD25,000 and USD500,000 (although some invest more). Venture capitalists won’t get out of bed for anything under USD2 million. Asking for either too much or too little will put investors off, so make sure you do your research. 
4. The stage your company is at and how much capital you need to achieve your next phase of growth 
When you pitch to investors, they will expect you to share how you plan to use their funds. The amount you ask for should match the cost of what you’re looking to achieve (with a reasonable buffer built in).      
5. How long you have to raise the capital you need Fundraising takes time. The more you’re looking to raise, the more time it’s going to take. If you don’t have a huge runway, it might be best to opt for a smaller fundraising target in the knowledge that you can raise more capital in your next round.
6. The number of investors that have shown an interest in your company Like many things in life, being in high demand is going to make your company look more attractive. Your ideal scenario is for investors to enter a bidding war. Common startup fundraising mistakes and how to avoid themIf you’re new to fundraising, here are a few common mistakes that you need to be wary of.  1. Don’t give away too much equity in the early stages of your business
  

The moment an investor shows an interest in your business is exciting, but it’s important not to get carried away and give away too much of your company in exchange for what may in the long-run be a small financial investment. 

If you give away too much of your business in the pre-seed and seed stages, you won’t have as much leverage when it comes to later funding rounds. 

An accurate valuation of your business will help you understand how much a stake in your company is really worth. 2. Don’t approach the wrong investors

Not every investor is going to be a good fit for your enterprise and approaching the wrong individuals is a waste of your time and their's. 

Likewise, successfully securing investment from someone you don’t want to work with for the next three to six years can be disastrous for your business. Make sure you do your research and source investors who are a good match for your vision. 3. Be confident but don’t oversell yourself

Telling everyone that your business is the new Microsoft isn’t going to make it true, and is likely to elicit an eye roll from jaded investors. Make sure your claims are based on hard facts and solid financial projections.  


4. Don’t ask for too little

You might think it’ll be easier to raise a small amount of capital, but this isn’t always the case. Investors are looking to make a decent return on their investment, and if you’re only asking for a few thousand dollars, investing is hardly going to be worth their time. Be bold with your growth ambitions and ask for the amount you need to achieve them. If investors think it’s too much, they can always negotiate you down. 
5. Don’t ask for too much

On the flip side, be wary of asking for unreasonable amounts of capital. Look at how much the investor usually puts into businesses at your stage of development. Explain clearly what you will use their money for and how their investment will lead to solid returns. 
6. Sell your idea

Before you get into the weeds with your financial projections and unit economics, don’t forget to sell yourself and your business. Investors need to believe in both you and your idea before they part with their money. A really strong pitch will communicate the ‘why’ of your company, so investors walk away understanding how your business is going to appeal to your target market. 
7. Don’t go in unprepared

It should go without saying, but make sure you have your facts straight before you pitch. You should be prepared to answer questions on how you plan to scale your business over the next 12 months, the size of your target market, what your monthly burn rate is, your financial projections for the next two years, your unit economics, marketing strategies and more. 

8. Don’t underestimate how long it takes

According to Alejandro Cremades, author of The Art of Startup Fundraising, when it comes to securing Series A investment, the due diligence process alone can take months. And even if you do secure investment it can take 90 days from your initial pitch to the money hitting your bank account. 

The moral of the story is that you should make sure you have a cash runway of 6 - 12 months before you start fundraising.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/protect-your-business-from-currency-volatility,How to protect your business from currency volatility and economic headwinds,"BlogHow to protect your business from currency volatility and economic headwindsTilly Michell6 October 2022•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•Why is the US dollar so strong right now?•What are the risks to global businesses?•How can businesses mitigate the risk?•How Airwallex can help your business hedge successfully navigate currency volatilityWith the US dollar sitting at the strongest it's ever been (and poised to get even stronger), markets are being rocked around the globe as they struggle to handle wild currency volatility. In July this year, the value of the dollar against other major currencies reached its highest level since the early 2000s, and equaled the value of the Euro for the first time in two decades. We sat down with Lee Kaznowski, Partner at Ascentis Accountants and Andrew Josephs, Director at ADJ Business Solutions, to discuss how currency volatility can affect your business, and what you can do to mitigate this ever-prevalent risk. Why is the US dollar so strong right now?Most asset classes have seen absolutely miserable returns in 2022, except for the United States dollar. The dollar has remained strong over the course of this year after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates in an effort to perturb the sky-high inflation the country was experiencing. To try and get a hold of inflation, the Federal Reserve actually raised interest rates at the fastest pace in a generation, causing a major problem for companies that do business globally.The dollar’s immense strength can be seen even more when compared to the terrible performance of stocks, bonds, crypto and real estate in the country over the same time period. Unfortunately for businesses, we’re currently experiencing a truly perfect storm of global economic chaos in all realism of the financial world, with warlike monetary policies, geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and the European energy crisis all major contributors. And to add to the situation - these volatile currency environments aren’t going away anytime soon, as Latin America and the Asia Pacific are set to also make a sizable contribution to heightened market volatility throughout the remainder of 2022. What are the risks to global businesses?Global businesses that rely on imports from the US, China or anywhere in the world where suppliers prefer to be paid in a foreign currency experience a rise in import costs when the value of their native currency falls.“The risk comes either when the company has international clients or is paying internationally,” says Andrew. “That’s when the volatile currency affects invoicing. I’ve got one client that invoices in euros because their clients are European-based. They've increased the euro amount of their annual membership because what they were getting from euro exchanges was less and less.”Even if your business doesn’t import directly or sell internationally, there is likely to be a reliance on imports somewhere down your supply chain. This creates a knock-on effect with far reaching consequences as prices rise and profit margins are squeezed. “When you’re dealing in multiple currencies it only takes a small change in the percentage of the exchange rate for it to have an impact,” says Lee. “I would say ordinarily, that can be both positive and negative for businesses. But at the current trajectory it just seems to be a cost, especially if you are looking to buy dollars.”How can businesses mitigate the risk?With the right strategies in place to organically reduce your net currency exposure and mitigate currency volatility, you can protect your business from currency headwinds or tailwinds. There are three ways internationally-trading businesses can protect themselves against the risks posed by market volatility: Pass on the risk to your suppliers and customers by operating in your native currency only or increasing your prices.Use forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations.Operate through a US dollar account. The drawback of the first two options is that unless you have leverage, global organisations and customers are unlikely to agree to take on the risk. Suppliers may refuse to invoice in your native currency and customers may insist on paying in dollars, or go elsewhere.  The third option however, allows businesses to avoid currency exchange altogether when the market is unfavourable. “If you’re invoicing in dollars and having to pay in dollars, just maintain that cash in a US dollar account,” Lee advises. “You’re only exposed to the risk at the point of transfer to your native currency. So as long as you don’t have to exchange the funds to your native currency, you don’t lose or gain at that point in time.”Here is where Airwallex can help businesses that operate across currencies. Say you’re an international eCommerce business. By opening a US dollar account with us, you can collect dollars from your US customers, hold those dollars in your account, and use them to pay international suppliers when needed using our Borderless Cards and Transfers. You can also wait for the exchange rate to become favourable, and exchange your dollars to AUD, HKD or SGD at a point when it benefits your business.   “I have clients that have saved money on FX because they are using Airwallex,” says Andrew. “My clients that work in multiple currencies, spend money in multiple currencies and need to travel have all seen a benefit in the ability to forward plan.” How Airwallex can help your business hedge successfully navigate currency volatilityWith Airwallex, you can open multiple foreign currency accounts from anywhere in the world - quickly, easily and for free. By opening multiple foreign currency accounts, including US dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan and more, you’re able to safeguard your business against the inevitable and damaging fluctuations of the forex market. “Our main advice whenever you deal with international trade — and this was our advice before the currency problems we’ve been having — is to limit the amount of times you have to convert currency,” says Lee. “Because every time you convert currency it will always cost you, even if you get a good rate. So setting up international bank accounts, and Airwallex is a great platform for setting up a number of international bank accounts, you can control the cost. You can choose when you want to change your money back into sterling.” Pranav Sood, GM, Airwallex EMEA says: “In uncertain times, businesses operating across borders need the right financial infrastructure in place to shield against market volatility. Airwallex gives businesses the freedom to scale globally without exposing themselves to unnecessary risk. With our solutions in place, they can collect and spend in multiple currencies whilst limiting currency exchange, and the anxiety that comes with it.” To set up an Airwallex account today, sign up free or speak to one of our advisors.Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

If you’re searching for investment capital to support your entrepreneurial dreams, read on. We’ll discuss where to find angel investors, the differences between angel investors and venture capitalists, and how to source the funds you need to succeed. Background on angel investmentsThe term ‘angel investor’ originates from Broadway. An “angel” was a wealthy individual who made beneficial donations to a theatre to support productions. 
Professor Bill Wetzel at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) dedicated his life to researching the techniques used by entrepreneurs to collect capital. The 1978 study defined terms such as “angel investors” to explain how wealthy individuals invested in startups.
Years later, in 1984, Professor Wetzel established the Centre for Venture Research for further research on angel investments, and to study successful entrepreneurial journeys.What are angel investors?Angel investors are affluent individuals who provide financial support for startups in the early stages of development, as well as for entrepreneurs who create new business ventures. In recent years, it’s estimated that about 300,000 people identified themselves as angel investors.According to data collected from the Centre of Venture Research’s 2021 analytical report, angel investments reached $29.1 billion, a 15.2% growth from 2020. Active investors exceeded 363,000 — an increase of 8.6% — in contrast to 2020’s list, which only included 334,680 angel investors.  The key services that angel investors provide to benefit a new business are:  Capital to get your startup off the ground and gain or sustain momentum.Entrepreneurial expertise to help less experienced founders achieve growth.A network of contacts that can help founders establish relationships with influential leaders in their industry.[Related: 10 key business metrics every startup founder needs to know]Comparing angel investors and venture capitalistsWhat’s the difference between angel investors and venture capitalists? 
A key differentiating factor is the stage at which angel investors provide capital to startups. Angel investors are more likely to invest in a business during seed stage. Venture capitalists typically join angel investors in financial support once a startup is more established and projects high growth potential. 
Angel investors are recognised as experienced assets for startups because they’re often successful entrepreneurs themselves, and therefore have the ability to share valuable information with new business owners. Angel investors vs venture capitalistsHere’s a rundown of how angel investors and venture capitalists differ from each other.

Angel investors:Affluent individuals who use their personal finances to provide support for a startup.Typically less risk-averse than venture capitalists. Invest their time, resources, experience and skills in the success of a startup. Play more of a supporting role with less control and demand over how you run the business. Venture capitalists:Investors that use other people’s money and are hired as a third party by a risk capital company. More concerned with growth potential and less eager to invest unless they can see a direct route to future profit. Venture capitalist firms generally invest a larger amount for a higher stake in equity. Demand for some operational input with more control and influence over the business.
To learn more about the venture capital perspective, explore this podcast: The Venture Capital Perspective with Kevin Spain, General Partner, Emergence CapitalWhat are the risks and benefits of angel investment?During a startup’s early stages, angel investments provide several benefits and limited risks. A key benefit of angel investments is that it gives your startup the credibility it needs to attract future investments, specifically from venture capitalists. Typically the more influential an angel is, the more they’ll help your startup stand out from competition and appeal to other investors. One thing to bear in mind is that your startup isn’t inherently guaranteed to succeed because of an angel’s investment or involvement. Many businesses still fail even if they’ve secured funds from angel investors or venture capitalists.  How much equity do angel investors take? Angel investors provide financial security for new business ventures to get off the ground. However, angels don’t invest for free. So, how do angel investors get their money back? 
In exchange for capital, angels take shares of equity in the business. They usually ask for an average of 10% to 25%.

Before you share your pitch with investors, practice perfecting your pitch so that it will leave them feeling inspired and informed about your business. What do angel investors look for in a startup?Angel investors are looking for several things in a startup, but the first thing is a clear business proposal. Your pitch should include forecasted turnover rates, profit margins, sales and growth potential. 
Angel investors also look for an engaging mission statement, a profitable purpose and a strong business strategy. 
To be considered for angel investments, you should ask yourself the following questions:Is your business pre-profit, pre-revenue or projected to be profitable?What is your annual turnover rate, profitability, sales, growth and earnings potential? How much capital are you looking for to get the company off the ground? Typically, you’ll be asking for a figure between USD25,000 and USD500,000 for an initial investment.How much equity are you willing to give away in exchange for investment? Will you be able to work with this angel investor for roughly three to eight years? Angel investors want to invest in companies with strong earning potential and inspiring mission statements. They need to believe in your business as much as you do. Practice your pitch!

In fact, analysts expect it to skyrocket to $2.64 trillion by 2028. 
If you’re an eCommerce business, this is a ripe opportunity to expand your customer base and grow your profits. For starters, eCommerce subscriptions make customers’ lives easier and bring in steady revenue. 
But to create a subscription service, you must understand how one works, your business’ options and the tools you need to bring it to life. 
In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to set up eCommerce subscriptions, and help you start planning. Your business will be selling subscriptions before you know it.
[Related: 4 Habits of highly successful eCommerce businesses]
Why choose an eCommerce subscription model? The most obvious reason to adopt an eCommerce subscription model is that it brings your business recurring revenue. 
We’ll define different eCommerce subscription model options below. For now, let’s look at the benefits your business can see when you use the subscription model in eCommerce. 
Top tip: Plug Airwallex into your eCommerce site and start accepting subscription payments from your global customers in 170+ currencies via 10+ payment methods. Our software handles the complex subscription logic, customer details and payment information. So you can sit back and put your recurring billing on autopilot.  
[Related: How to shift your products online in 8 easy steps]Retain customersWhen customers make a one-time purchase, your business earns revenue. But when a customer buys and subscribes, you’ve got a locked retention period for that customer. And when customers are satisfied with the products and/or services you provide and the money they save, they’re likely to renew their subscription. 
It’s a quality inherent in eCommerce subscriptions. However, to keep retaining customers, make sure they have flexibility in their membership. They should be able to change their schedule, opt out, change a date or shift plans easily.
That flexibility is a massive part of the subscription model’s appeal. When customers are happy, they’ll come back.Gain recurring revenue This is the clearest benefit for your business. You secure payments for set periods, and customers’ subscriptions bring them convenience and quality products/services.
To make sure your business incrementally increases repeat revenue through eCommerce subscriptions, scrutinise your key performance indicators (KPIs) regularly. That way, you know you’re bringing in profit, gaining customers and making your subscription service worthwhile.
Boost customer lifetime valueBetter customer lifetime value (CLV) is another quality that accompanies an eCommerce subscription model. Customers know what they’ll receive and when, and they’ll likely remain subscribers when your products/services make the grade. And when you know a customer’s purchase timing, you can calculate CLV with much greater accuracy.
Plus, with highly satisfactory eCommerce subscriptions, your SMB has less risk of customers making one-time purchases. After customers agree to a set payment and delivery service, your CLV benefits in the short and long terms. 
And to make matters better, increased CLV leads to decreased customer acquisition costs (CAC). Control inventoryLet’s say you know what customers want and when. With a few KPI calculations, you can fine-tune exactly how much raw material and labour you’ll need in the next measurement period.
The ability to control how much inventory you have on hand is invaluable. For instance, if you deal in perishable goods, having a backlog can lead to waste and longer acquisition times. If you sell products very specific to a customer bracket, you can determine how many items to keep in storage on average (e.g. 10% high-end, 50% midline and 40% budget items).
For instance, with eCommerce subscriptions, you know for certain that X number of customers want X items in X weeks. The ability to assess and control inventory saves time and money as well as avoids overstocking and understocking.
[Related: Top stock control methods to master inventory management]Attract investorsAttracting investors is a top priority for any SMB. Fortunately, using the subscription model in eCommerce can draw them to your business — if you can show solid numbers and innovation.
Investors look for strong customer relationships and predictable revenue, and eCommerce subscriptions tend to produce both. As a result, your SMB looks far more enticing to investors when it has financial stability and growth potential. But back to those numbers.
You should be able to show increased customer subscriptions (even if the trend is gradual), low churn and glowing reviews. Because customers trust reviews more than they trust ads, sound reviews mean you’re fulfilling your promise and building customer loyalty. That cycle leads to investors’ attention.
[Related: Net revenue retention and 3 things every venture capitalist looks for]Create a fantastic customer experienceIt’s one of your greatest (if not the greatest) goals — give customers a spectacular shopping experience. An eCommerce subscription model provides you with special opportunities to make customers happy while meeting previously unaddressed needs.
Although convenience, savings and flexibility are key to a great customer experience, meeting an unexpected need is a smart tactic. Perhaps you introduce customers to products they didn’t know existed or give them the chance to try something new. In the end, customers should be satisfied with what they bought and how they’ll save with eCommerce subscriptions.
And as any savvy SMB knows, satisfied customers lead to repeat business, which leads to greater revenue. With eCommerce subscriptions, customers can get a “one-and-done” service alongside savings.
Now, let’s look at the three primary eCommerce subscription models. You’ll need to choose the one most appropriate for your eCommerce SMB.
How to set up a subscription serviceWhen you’re ready to sell subscriptions online, you’ll need to examine your eCommerce SMB through micro and macro lenses. 
For instance, are your products appropriate for an online subscription service, and will customers want to sign up? How will they benefit from membership? 
And you must ask concrete questions about your SMB. Are your KPIs at a place where you can set up an online subscription service? Which eCommerce subscription platform or software will you use, and how will customers pay?
[Related: How to sell online internationally with Shopify]
1. Check how your products or services fit the market.Because eCommerce subscriptions should grow even more popular in the next decade, your SMB will face lots of competition. Look closely at your SMB’s niche and biggest competitors. Will you be able to stand out and stay viable with eCommerce subscriptions? 
If you find you’ll be a small fish in a big pond, explore ways to set yourself apart. Can you offer an angle that few other SMBs do? When you have a definite strategy, you can move forward with greater confidence.2. Pick the most appropriate eCommerce subscription model.So, which eCommerce subscription model best fits your products or services? You might discover all three could work, but one should fit closest (your KPIs factor in, too).
For instance, your SMB might sell coffee. The replenishment model would fit, but curation could work if you sell various artisan coffees. Regardless, the replenishment eCommerce subscription model should be best — consumables and replenishment go hand in hand.
Later, you might expand and offer two or more subscription options. It’s wise to watch how successful your first efforts are, then move forward if they work well.3. Nail down which incentives you’ll offer.Next, determine how exactly a subscription will benefit customers. Can you afford to offer a discount on all products, or would it work better to offer a specialised box of your most popular products?
For instance, you might offer customers a discount proportional to their plan. If customers subscribe to an annual plan, they receive 15% off all goods. If they subscribe monthly, they receive a 10% discount.
6. Find the best eCommerce subscription software for your SMB.Now to the tech side — you need to find the right software to handle your subscription service. 
Here’s where Airwallex can help. The benefits of using Airwallex subscription management software include:Sell globally from day one - accept recurring payments in 170+ currencies Allow customers to pay the way they want, with 10+ global payment methodsEasily adjust your subscription model and pricing strategy with our simple APIOur simple ‘plug and play’ solution requires minimal development work. Simply plug our payment form into your existing checkout and instantly start accepting paymentsOur software integrates with leading eCommerce platforms including Shopify, WooCommerce and MagentoCustomise the payment form to suit your brand Avoid unnecessary FX conversions and improve your profit margins4. Create a marketing plan to attract customers.Now that you’ve determined your tactics, craft a marketing strategy to make sure customers will know about the subscription option! A clear banner on your website home page could note the new service, and email/SMS marketing comes in handy, too. 
The subscription option and its benefits should also appear prominently on the checkout page. Simply presenting the service and its benefits can turn one-time customers into subscribers. 5. Establish a customer retention strategy.Make sure customers will stay satisfied with their subscription and what they receive from it. Of course, your products should remain high-quality and have timely delivery. But little perks can lead to much better customer retention and word of mouth.
Let’s return to the example of an SMB that sells coffee. Perhaps customers get a ceramic mug with their first shipment, and they receive extras or samples when they refer friends. Remember to leave customers options, like skipping a shipment — that flexibility helps retention.
You’ll see some churn, which is natural. However, when customers stay engaged (and even intrigued), they’re more likely to stay subscribed.
[Related: The best D2C platforms for international eCommerce]7. Ensure you have the right financial infrastructure in placeThis step is particularly important for eCommerce businesses that sell on a global scale. 
If your customers are paying in multiple currencies, it’s important to have the right financial infrastructure in place to ensure you’re not caught out by unnecessary FX conversions and fees. 
When you sign up to Airwallex, you’ll get a free Global Account which will allow you to collect, hold and spend in multiple currencies with no monthly fees.
If, for example, you have customers in Europe, the UK and America, you can collect subscription payments in EUR, GBP and USD, hold those funds in your account, and use them to pay suppliers, staff and bills, all whilst avoiding FX fees. 
If you do want to convert currencies, you’ll benefit from Airwallex’s market-leading FX rates.  8. Keep tabs on your progress.Like with any other marketing effort, you’ll need to monitor KPIs before, during and after starting eCommerce subscriptions. 
However, some KPIs particularly apply to eCommerce subscriptions:Gross merchandise value (GMV)Buy-to-subscriber ratio (BSR) CLV Number of active subscribers (AR) As you check your metrics, listen to customers and tactfully solicit feedback. Then, you can review your numbers again and adjust your options per both insights.
You can check many other KPIs, especially customer acquisition cost (CAC), monthly recurring revenue (MRR), average revenue per user (ARPU) and churn. But don’t get bogged down. 
Carefully weigh your options, and choose the best subscription eCommerce platform and payment gateway for your SMB. When you do, monitoring your metrics is simpler.

Types of eCommerce subscription modelsBefore you create a subscription service, you must decide which eCommerce subscription model is most apt for your SMB, products and customers. Let’s look closely at each so you can weigh your options and the model’s benefits.ReplenishmentThe word itself may sound high-brow, but it’s actually quite simple. With a replenishment eCommerce subscription model, your SMB replaces consumable items on a regular basis. 
This is a particularly popular eCommerce subscription model because customers are going to use products — primarily food/beverage and personal care products. Receiving items they regularly use on set dates simply makes customers’ lives easier.
After all, people are going to run out of standard items (e.g. deodorant, toilet paper, cosmetics). Your SMB can simplify their lives by saving them repeat orders — or helping them remember to order. A replenishment model is especially apt if your SMB offers consumable or one-time use goods.
For instance, if your SMB sells soaps, this is a solid model. If your SMB sells furniture, this model probably isn’t for you.
[Related: What eCommerce businesses need to know about Amazon Pay]CurationAgain, the term might sound fancy, but it’s basic in meaning. 
With a curation eCommerce subscription model, you work with customers’ preferences and send packages (often a monthly “box”) tailored to their tastes. You can place a survey or questionnaire on your subscription service website to quiz customers on their likes and dislikes.
This is an excellent model when your eCommerce SMB offers an array of products or services that complement one another. You’ll need to do your research — delve into customers’ demographics and buying behaviours. The packages you send will differ per customer or customer group.
This model may demand additional effort, but it’s worthwhile. Some of the most memorable reviews come from meeting customers’ unique expectations. When you deliver a spot-on box of goods, for instance, customers are likely to spread the word — and free marketing is always great!
In fact, 80% of customers are more likely to buy when you personalise their shopping experience. As a result, your eCommerce SMB’s popularity grows, your revenue increases and investors become more interested. Access or membershipYou can think of the access eCommerce subscription model as a “members-only” club. The key is selling customers quality products at a sizable discount — they’ll want their membership to be worthwhile. As opposed to receiving discounts on specific goods, they receive discounts on all goods under an umbrella fee.
Customers pay a regular amount (usually monthly or annually) and receive perks. These could be sneak peeks at new products, discounts on bulk products, access to luxury goods at lower prices or other exclusive offers. The model’s main benefits for SMBs are locked-in payments and less work from across-the-board discounts.
An access eCommerce subscription model is apt when your SMB has a definite target audience and can offer blanket discounts that make memberships valuable. As with other models, your SMB must deliver on its promise: guaranteeing customers stay pleased and save money.
Successful eCommerce subscription businessesYou’re likely familiar with major businesses that offer subscribe-and-save options (e.g. Amazon, Walmart, Target). 
However, some of the most successful eCommerce subscription services are SMBs — or started as SMBs. Again, two categories dominate: food/beverages and personal care/beauty. Other categories, like fashion, collectibles, health care and pet care, are gaining momentum.
You’ll notice explicit traits in successful businesses offering eCommerce subscriptions. They offer specialised products or fulfil an ongoing need. Plus, they skilfully took advantage of an open place in the market.
For instance, customers may not have the time or energy to shop for healthy meals. Or perhaps a customer demographic needs personal care products but doesn’t care to shop around for them. Other SMBs may see a fairly small but loyal niche and cement themselves as a go-to service for items in that category.
In sum, successful businesses offer customers something special with their eCommerce subscriptions. Here’s just a handful of highly successful businesses using an eCommerce subscription model:Blue Apron. This online subscription service delivers fresh ingredients and meal kits directly to customers. Subscribers have a wide variety of plans to choose from, and they can select plans per dietary needs and preferences. Dollar Shave Club. This service ships customers razors and personal grooming products. It upsells by offering additional personal care products, like facial lotions and creams, alongside its primary product.Loot Crate. This business saw an excellent opportunity and seized it. Noting buying potential in self-defined “nerds,” it sends curated boxes of gaming and pop culture merchandise to select fandoms.Peloton. A fitness service, Peloton sells subscriptions that provide thousands of virtual fitness classes. Customers can use these classes with its primary high-priced products (e.g. smart exercise bikes and treadmills). Customers get a few virtual classes with its main products, but a subscription gives them access to practically countless options.SmartyPits. People purchase deodorant — it’s just a fact. This online subscription service delivers all-natural deodorants to customers who want to avoid aluminium and chemicals (and hassle).These subscription services clearly offer products that customers either definitely need (e.g. food, personal care) or want (e.g. collectibles, online classes). They also range from basic products to high-tech goods. Some eCommerce subscriptions offer both!
Ultimately, each stays successful by making customers’ lives easier — or simply more fun.
Five steps to make your subscription business a successOnce your SMB’s eCommerce subscriptions are live, you’ll need to take steps to ensure they remain viable. Considering how to attract and retain customers in the short and long terms is crucial.1. Find your ideal customer base and niche.Identify your core customer type and broadest audience to tailor eCommerce subscriptions. When you know your audience, you can accurately adjust both large and small aspects — from products offered to timing and pricing.
As we’ve noted, finding a unique angle can boost any SMB’s success. This is doubly true in terms of eCommerce subscriptions! 
Let’s say an eCommerce SMB’s customer base consists of millennial women. The SMB sells flower and vegetable seeds. The SMB decides to sell subscriptions online per the curation model, and it delivers monthly boxes specific to that audience’s preferences and the growing season.
Tip: To boost engagement, the SMB could offer access to exclusive forums, send weekly gardening tips and upsell equipment via discounts. By knowing its customers and adding subscription perks, the SMB keeps customers happy with innovative offerings.2. Make sure you have your costs correct.To take on eCommerce subscriptions in the first place, you must consider your SMB’s metrics. This includes what you can offer, when to offer it and what discounts are feasible. And that’s not just when determining how to set up a subscription service.
You should monitor those KPIs regularly:GMVBSRCLVARCACMRRARPUChurnIf your numbers aren’t in order, you could lose revenue after your initial investment in eCommerce subscriptions. With the best subscription eCommerce platform for your SMB, you can see how your numbers stack up.
[Related: Choosing your North Star metric]3. Create memorable packaging while cross-selling when possible.Customers may find eCommerce subscriptions truly delightful, and how products arrive can be a major factor. When you can cross-sell with or in packaging, you’ve raised your chances of making more sales.
Let’s say the aforementioned gardening SMB sends seeds in a wooden box tied with twine. The box contains not only customer-tailored seeds but also coupon codes for potting soil, trowels and ceramic planters. When the SMB knows it can afford such packaging, it’s made its eCommerce subscriptions memorable and charming.
Plus, it’s likely to gain additional profit from items that may not sell as quickly as its main product.4. Market your subscription service in plain, straightforward language.Use clear, concise language when marketing eCommerce subscriptions. No customer likes to wade through heavy, tiresome text. Plus, it may seem as though you’re being dishonest or secretive if you use complex language.
If a customer feels a business is trying to con them, they’re unlikely to become a subscriber. This is particularly true on the checkout page, where customers want to know exactly what they’ll save and what they’re signing up for. After all, pretty much everyone prefers to check the bare facts when it comes to spending money.5. Use the best eCommerce subscription platform and payment gateway.We must drive home this point — it’s difficult to succeed when your platform (or software) and payment gateway don’t deliver a seamless experience. This is true for both your SMB and customers. 
Customers don’t like getting bounced from one service or platform to the next, which can lead to higher churn. SMBs benefit all around from customer satisfaction and the insights that top-notch eCommerce subscription software can provide. 
You may have sound plans and product offerings set up. But if you haven’t built them on a firm foundation, they’re much less likely to garner that repeat revenue from eCommerce subscriptions.

But the LTV CAC ratio is important, too. 
The LTV to CAC ratio represents the amount of profit a customer brings in over the expense it takes to acquire and convince them to buy your product or service. 
It’s one of the most important business metrics your startup should monitor when analysing your business’s growth, progress and success. 
And although calculating your LTV to CAC ratio isn’t difficult, the process of knowing it and taking steps to improve it is the real test. 
Here, we’ll run you through how to calculate your ratio, answer the question: 'What is a good LTV to CAC ratio?’ and address methods for improving yours. What is customer lifetime value (LTV)?
Customer LTV (aka CLV or CLTV) is a metric that represents the total amount of revenue your business can expect from one customer throughout your relationship with them. It’s the monetary value you’ll earn from a single customer’s predicted account lifespan. 
So, the longer a single customer continues to purchase from your business, the greater their LTV becomes. 
This is why it’s important to prioritize customer support and success. Those aspects help improve a customer’s journey, which makes it more likely that they’ll remain loyal to your business. 
LTV helps your business identify segments and target customers more effectively to boost loyalty. And while losing customers isn’t always a bad thing, it never hurts to reduce churn! 
[Related: How to calculate and improve monthly recurring revenue (MRR)]What is customer acquisition cost (CAC)? Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the total amount of sales and marketing costs required to gain a new customer.
Your CAC includes any expenses related to your marketing programmes, salaries and commissions, as well as any overhead costs put towards attracting leads and turning them into customers. 
Regardless of the business sector you’re in, the goal is to make your CAC as low as possible. Having a low CAC doesn’t just help you increase your profits — it’s also a sign that your sales, marketing and service programmes are healthy and in good standing. 
You can think of CAC as a comparison between the amount of money you spend on attracting customers versus the number of customers you actually gain. 
Additionally, retained customers are happy ones. And because they're satisfied with the services or products your business provides, they’re more likely to leave positive reviews and testimonials, as well as refer others to your business. This helps you gain more leads at no cost.
And if those leads become customers, that further lowers your CAC. How to calculate LTV to CAC ratioCalculating your LTV CAC ratio means dividing the total sales of a single customer over their lifetime with your business by the amount of money it takes to “convince” a customer to make their first purchase. 
That said, you have to know how to calculate your LTV and CAC separately. How to calculate customer lifetime value (LTV)Lifetime value is the implied monetary value throughout the time a customer purchases from your business. 
Now, let’s go over how to calculate customer lifetime value (LTV). 
Here’s the customer lifetime value formula:
LTV = 1 ÷ Churn rate percentage 
As with any business, sometimes you lose customers — this is your churn. 
In the case of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, sometimes customers unsubscribe or stop purchasing. Your churn rate is the percentage of existing customers who unsubscribe or stop purchasing from your business within a given year. 
In terms of SaaS businesses, if your annual customer churn rate is 7% (meaning 7% of existing customers canceled their subscriptions or another service, depending on your SaaS business type), then your LTV is 1 ÷ 7%, which is about 14 years. This is the average length of time a customer continues their relationship with your business. 
Now that you know how to calculate your LTV, we’ll move on to CAC.How to calculate customer acquisition cost (CAC)Calculating customer acquisition cost isn’t difficult. And once we have it, it becomes the denominator in the LTV CAC ratio. 
CAC is the total amount of money it costs to convince a customer to make their first purchase. You can think of it as the sum of your sales and marketing expenses divided by the number of new customers you acquire. Or in other words, it’s the number of leads who become customers.
Here’s the formula for calculating cost per acquisition:
Customer acquisition cost (CAC) = Total sales and marketing costs ÷ Number of newly acquired customers
Before looking at a calculating cost of customer acquisition example, you should know that acquiring new customers requires using a variety of tactics. Such tactics include methods for effective marketing, use of sales channel outlets (e.g. social media, website work) and even in-person efforts.For example, if you run an eCommerce business, your numbers for calculating CAC for a particular month might look like this:Marketing expenses: USD10,000 for paid advertising and content marketing Sales expenses: USD21,000 for a sales campaignAdditional expenses or maintenance costs: USD4,000Number of customers acquired: 437Using the numbers above, you can add your total expenses (in this case, they equal USD35,000). Then, divide that value by 437. Your CAC is just over USD80.
So, what is a good customer acquisition cost? Well, it depends. 
You want your LTV CAC ratio to be 3:1. So knowing whether your CAC is good depends on how high your LTV is. How to calculate your LTV CAC ratioYou can measure the effectiveness of your sales and marketing strategies using the LTV CAC ratio. To calculate your LTV CAC ratio, simply divide your LTV by your CAC. 
Here’s the ​​LTV CAC ratio formula:
LTV CAC ratio = LTV ÷ CAC
The US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) have reporting standards that fall on the traditional side. They especially fall short when examining the financial performance of SaaS businesses. 
That’s why eCommerce and SaaS businesses usually rely on their own set of key business metrics to bridge what GAAP standards miss. Businesses with repeat purchases (e.g. eCommerce and SaaS businesses) are direct-to-consumer, which is why it’s helpful to know LTV, CAC and the LTV CAC ratio.
The LTV CAC ratio helps startups take specific actions:Examining the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of their sales and marketing effortsDetermining whether their customer acquisition strategies are feasible in the long term[Related: Key performance indicators for emerging eCommerce businesses]What is a good LTV to CAC ratio? The ideal LTV CAC ratio is 3:1. This means you should aim to earn three times more than what you spend on acquiring customers. 
If your ratio is less than 3, you should look into how to lower customer acquisition cost. This usually means reducing your sales and marketing expenses — at least for a bit.
[Related: Profit margins: 5 things every startup founder needs to know]How to improve your LTV to CAC ratioHere are some tips for improving your CAC LTV model. Use the right channels The sales channels that might attract and snag the most customers aren’t always the ones that work best if customers are quickly churning. 
Investing in channels that boost your inbound marketing is ideal. About 81% of customers do research before making a purchase. So if you have a focused, targeted approach, the leads you attract are likely to be more interested in the services or products you offer. 
You’ll end up with more loyal, long-term customers, and you’ll spend less money on attracting them. Reduce complexity of salesIf you have a complex sales process or a sales cycle that’s on the longer side, your CAC will inevitably be higher. 
Your startup should aim to engage prospects with a simple yet effective onboarding process. If shopping is a hassle and hardly fun, who would do it, right?
Invest in a tight funnel that makes each step in the sales process easy to understand and navigate. This will help you gain and retain more customers. Change your pricing structure
Try experimenting with your pricing. 
You could even try pricing tiers (e.g. feature-based, seat-based) or add-on options. 
The more customers you move from a cheap or freemium plan to a premium plan, the lower your CAC will be. 
So if you want to be profitable and improve customers’ time to value, you simply have to reduce your cost of revenue. And most of that cost comes from CAC if you’re a digital business.

Knowing your eCommerce SMB’s KPIs helps you determine your financial health. 
Contribution margin is one of those key KPIs. 
Calculating contribution margin lets you know how much profit you make off each product or service you sell. And it can help you determine which products or services to keep, discard, upsell or downsell. 
Below, we’ll go into more details about what contribution margin is and how to calculate it. 
Note: Keep in mind that contribution margin doesn’t fall under the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). If you do a lot of business in the US, avoid contribution margin in financial reporting. It’s most useful when analysing your products and/or services, pricing and productivity. 
[Related: How to calculate cost of sales for your business]Contribution margin definition: What is contribution margin? So, what does contribution margin mean? 
Contribution margin is a measure of how much revenue a certain item is making (or costing) your business. Put simply, it’s the amount left after you subtract variable costs from total revenue.
You can calculate contribution margin per unit (i.e. product or service) or overall (i.e. your total cost of production). 
Increasing your overall contribution margin can help you reach your break-even point — a crucial measure of your SMB’s health. Contribution margin per unit is especially important for SMBs because each product or service counts towards your total revenue.
Plus, knowing your contribution margin gives you an excellent way of determining how or whether you should adjust product prices. The more you know about your products, the better you can assess your customer lifetime value.
It’s a fairly simple concept, but you’ll need to know what your variable and fixed costs are beforehand. And that process can be a bit more complicated than it first seems.
We’ll expand on fixed vs variable costs later — determining what expenses fall into which category can be tricky. 
[Related: 4 Habits of highly successful eCommerce businesses]Contribution margin formula, CM ratio formula and other KPI formulasAlthough the core contribution margin formula is simple, other calculations may help your SMB fine-tune its offerings, prices and products. Alongside contribution margin, here are other helpful KPI formulas. Keep in mind that for each formula, the time period measured should be the same (e.g. quarterly, annually).
First, here’s how to find the contribution margin in the most basic sense (a dollar amount):
Total revenue − Variable costs = Contribution margin
After learning how to calculate contribution margin, many SMBs find it useful to know the contribution margin per unit value. Here’s the contribution margin per unit formula: 
(Total revenue − Variable costs) ➗ Total units = Contribution margin per unit
Next, let’s look at how to calculate contribution to profit using the contribution margin per unit value. Here’s the formula:
Contribution margin per unit ✖ Number of units sold = Contribution to profit
Next, you can find your contribution margin (CM) ratio. What is a contribution margin ratio? Essentially, it’s your contribution margin as a percentage.
Here’s how to find the CM ratio (a percentage):
(Total revenue − Variable costs) ➗ Revenue = CM ratio
However, it makes sense to find your gross profit margin as well. You should know the cost of goods sold (COGS):
Total revenue − COGS = Gross profit margin
Contribution margin and gross profit margin differ, but they are related. We’ll get into that relationship in greater depth shortly.
Knowing a product’s contribution margin as a dollar amount and as a percentage can give you separate insights. For instance, the dollar amount may help you adjust prices, but the percentage may help you plan overall pricing strategies.
[Related: How to calculate opportunity cost]Fixed costs vs variable costsOn the surface, the difference between fixed costs and variable costs is simple. Fixed costs are costs that remain the same regardless of sales and production. Variable costs change according to sales and production and fall under COGS. 
For instance, let’s say your eCommerce SMB sells woven baskets. You may rent a warehouse monthly or yearly. That rent is a fixed cost because you must pay it to keep production stable.
However, variable costs shift, often per time period. For instance, the raw materials you use to make woven baskets, such as rope and paint, may change per season. If holidays (e.g. Easter, Halloween) increase your sales volume, then your variable costs for those raw materials increase alongside demand and production.
When you know your contribution margin, you can adjust variable costs to cover fixed costs. In fact, that’s one of the most important insights an SMB can gain from knowing its contribution margin.
[Related: How to calculate net working capital and why it’s important]Contribution margin vs gross profit marginBoth contribution margin and gross profit margin help you gauge your SMB’s profitability. 
However, contribution margin helps you determine how well a particular product or service benefits or harms your bottom line. Gross profit margin helps you determine how well your SMB performs overall because it takes into account all COGS, not just variable costs.
You might think of it as looking at your SMB’s productivity through micro and macro lenses. Contribution margin is the micro metric, and gross profit margin is the macro metric.Contribution margin examplesNext, we’ll look at a straightforward contribution margin example. Let’s return to the eCommerce SMB selling woven baskets. For this example, let’s say the time period is one quarter.The SMB’s net revenue is USD200,000.It has sold 5,000 baskets.The price per unit is USD40.The variable cost per unit is USD10.Using the contribution margin per unit formula, subtract the variable cost per unit from the price per unit: USD40 minus USD10 equals USD30.The contribution to profit per the contribution margin is USD30 multiplied by 5,000, or USD150,000.The CM ratio is USD150,000 divided by USD200,000, which equals 3/4 or 75%.[Related: The pain-free guide to managing business expenses]How to use contribution margin in your businessYou can use contribution margin to examine which products help or hurt your overall revenue. This boils down to basic logic. If a product doesn’t sell enough to justify its production expenses, then it’s wise to take one of three main actions:Stop selling that product.Decrease its variable costs (e.g. components, labour).Raise the product’s price. Each option comes with potential risks, of course. 
For instance, a product may be consistently popular but not always sell in large quantities (i.e. a “cash cow”). In that case, stopping product sales would hurt revenue in the long term by cutting a regular cash flow contributor and hurting ROI.
Decreasing variable costs may lead to a lower-quality product that customers dislike or stop buying. Cutting variable costs may also lead to poor reviews, which hurt your SMB’s reputation. And naturally, raising a product’s price (even slightly) can turn customers away altogether.
However, you should take into account other KPIs before making any sweeping decisions. It’s certainly wise to double-check what you have listed as fixed and as variable costs — like we said, the categories can be tricky. Examining your revenue through a micro lens alone won’t give you a complete financial view.
Although contribution margin is definitely important, it’s only one piece of a much larger picture.
Speaking of larger pictures, via contribution margin analysis, you can take the same concept and apply it to teams, divisions and other aspects of your SMB. But that’s a matter all its own. For now, let’s stick with the product level — it’s closer to the heart of eCommerce.
[Related: The advantages and disadvantages of retained profit]How investors use contribution marginAs if you needed another reason to examine contribution margin, investors look at it to determine whether an SMB uses its funds effectively. 
If an SMB has a high contribution margin, then it likely makes more money than it spends. Likewise, if an SMB has a low contribution margin, then it probably spends more money than it makes.
You can see why this would make a major difference to investors. If an SMB doesn’t use its funding wisely or doesn’t make enough money, then it’s not worth investing in. Savvy investors would steer clear of an SMB with consistently poor contribution margins. What is a good contribution margin?The best way to view a “good” contribution margin is through the CM ratio. When the percentage is close to 100%, that’s a good contribution margin. In short, the higher it is, the better your SMB is performing.
Your SMB probably has sound chances of covering its fixed costs when its contribution margin is close to 100%. And when you can cover your fixed costs, you’re closer to making steady, higher profits.

The three types of profit margin•2. Profit is not the only way to benchmark your business•3. Investors may be more interested in growth than profit•4. Losing customers can be a good thing (sometimes)•5. The right financial infrastructure is crucialProfit margins are an important aspect of starting and running a business. And while reading the word “profit” may either stress or motivate you, we should think about the concept with some leeway. 
Here are five things every startup founder needs to know about profit margins. 1. The three types of profit marginThere are three ways to measure profit margin. Let’s look at what they are and how to calculate them. Gross profit marginGross profit margin (GPM) is the relationship between your startup’s gross revenue from sales and the direct cost to produce the goods and services you provide. Your income statement typically lists this in the first section.
GPM indicates how efficiently a business produces a product or service. Depending on your area of business, your startup will have varying types of direct production costs. If your business sells physical products, you’ll have the cost of goods sold (COGS). Other businesses might have a more general direct cost reference.
Here’s the gross profit margin formula:
Gross profit margin = [(Gross profit ➗ Revenue) ✖ 100]
To find the GPM percentage, divide your gross profit by your total revenue, then multiply that total by 100. 
It’s better to have a high GPM percentage because it indicates your total gross profit per dollar earned. Operating profit marginOperating profit margin (OPM) is the second number that a business looks at on its income statement. OPM focuses on indirect costs. 
Most businesses have a range of indirect costs that factor into their bottom line. Here are some examples of reported indirect costs:Research and developmentMarketing campaign expensesAdministrative expensesDepreciation and amortisationWhen looking at your OPM, you can examine the effects these indirect costs have on your business. So, when looking at your income statement, you can see whether the areas your startup is investing in are positively or negatively affecting your growth.  
Here’s the operating profit margin formula:
Operating profit margin = [(Operating profit ➗ Revenue) ✖ 100]
To find your operating profit, subtract your operating expenses from your gross profit (i.e. revenue). Then, to find the OPM, divide your operating profit by your total revenue (i.e. gross profit). 
While your company may have a high GPM, its OPM could be low if you have high indirect costs, such as staff salaries, licensing fees or marketing efforts. Net profit marginNet profit margin (NPM) is the third number that a business looks at on an income statement. NPM takes into account interests and taxes owed by a business, operating costs and costs of goods sold (COGS).
Essentially, NPM is your profit margin after accounting for everything — it’s your bottom line. 
To calculate your NPM, first calculate your net profit. You can do this by subtracting your taxes and interest expenses, operational costs and COGS from your operating profit. Operating profit is also called earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).
Then, you can calculate your NPM percentage. Here’s the net profit margin formula:
Net profit margin = [(Net income ➗ Revenue) ✖ 100]
To better understand the calculation, follow these steps:Determine your startup’s net income by subtracting your expenses from your revenue.Then, divide your startup’s calculated net income by your revenue (also referred to as net sales).Lastly, multiply that calculated total by 100, which will give you your overall profit margin percentage.[Related: 10 business metrics every startup founder needs to know]2. Profit is not the only way to benchmark your businessBenchmarking is the process of measuring your business’s success and then comparing the findings against your competitors. That comparison helps you discover areas that can be improved. 
But how exactly do you measure success? 
You can measure key performance indicators such as products, services and general results. Each type of benchmarking serves a unique purpose that helps businesses reach their goals. 
Here are the six most significant types of benchmarking:Internal: Compare processes within a businessExternal: Compare to other businessesCompetitive: Compare to direct competitors, specificallyPerformance: Set performance standards by analysing metricsStrategic: Evaluate the strategies of other successful companies Practice: Process mapping and addressing performance gapsAdditionally, here are some specific benchmark metric examples used for strategising financial and operational goals.Financial metrics: GPM, NPM, OPM and customer acquisition costs to name a fewOperational metrics: conversion rates, churn rate, amount of cancellations and/or returns and more. Businesses look at different types of benchmark metrics depending on their size and goals. 
For example, a large eCommerce enterprise like Amazon is likely to use a benchmark metric that improves productivity and boosts marketing efforts in order to break into new markets. Whereas, a startup specialising in SEO might use benchmark metrics related to number of page views or link clicks. 
[Related: How to calculate burn rate (the right way!)]3. Investors may be more interested in growth than profitAs a startup founder, profit matters when you’re low on funds, but it’s not the only indicator of success. 
Some businesses veer from profitability in their early years so they can invest more revenue into growth. That money might go towards hiring more people, building out their product or service, or acquiring new customers. 
For this reason, profitability is not necessarily a deal-breaker when it comes to startups securing investment. 
Investors care about long term growth. A startup that is initially profitable but eventually sizzles out is much worse than one that grows steadily and reaches profitability over a number of years. 
Businesses that invest in growth early on are likely to become more profitable down the line. In the long run, signs of growth are often more important in an investor's eyes because those signs indicate that they’re going to earn their investment back.
[Related: Net revenue retention and 3 things every venture capitalist should look for]4. Losing customers can be a good thing (sometimes)Losing customers can be nerve wracking. But it’s not always a bad thing! 
Let’s explore a couple of industry examples. eCommerceAn eCommerce business decides to put its prices up and cut some lower-value items from its inventory. 
After calculating their profit margins and customer lifetime value, they discover that some customers are actually losing the business money, because they're only buying low-value items from the website on a one-off basis. These customers do not generate enough revenue to justify the money it costs to acquire them and fulfil their orders. 
The company knows that raising their prices will cause them to lose some customers. But as those customers are not generating profit, this is not a bad thing. Professional services
An SEO agency offers a range of services including link-building, content optimization, and more. However, the agency only earns profit from clients who use its premium service.
Looking at OPM, the business realises that their account managers are spending a lot of time onboarding and managing clients that don't generate much profit for the company. 
The business decides to strip back its offering and focus on its premium services only. They know they will lose some customers, but they also know those customers were never going to generate long-term profits for their business.Gaining vs retaining customers
Your startup should ultimately be aiming to engage a high number of loyal customers who generate recurring revenue for your business. 
By not wasting resources on unprofitable customers, you may find you have more time and money to engage customers who are likely to generate real growth for your business. 
5. The right financial infrastructure is crucialBuilding the right financial infrastructure into your business is the best way to ensure you keep a firm grip on your profitability metrics, and don’t waste money on needless bank fees. 
This is particularly true for global businesses with customers and suppliers around the world.
Many businesses struggle with their accounts because they manage global revenue and expenses across several foreign currency bank accounts. This creates a fractured financial experience, costs a lot of money in bank fees, and makes reconciliation and reporting that much harder. 
Airwallex is an all-in-one financial suite which allows businesses to collect customer payments in multiple currencies, pay international suppliers, and manage global expenses, without high fees.

Efficient payments, better profit margins 📈Payment Links and Xero Invoice Payments are a great way to ensure your customers pay you promptly. The only problem is that some payment processors — including Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Apple Pay — apply surcharges for online payments.If you’re based in Australia, Singapore or Hong Kong, you can now pass these surcharges on to your customers. A payment processing fee will be added automatically to your customers’ bill if they select a payment option where surcharges apply. So, you can get paid fast without denting your profits. Click here to learn more or reach out to your Account Manager. Enjoy even smoother reconciliation 🚣‍♀️ We’ve made it easier to reconcile customer payments in Xero. Settlement will now be broken out by individual transactions, making it easy to match transactions with invoices and separate out revenue from fees. Xero users can also now import Xero contact data (aka your vendors) into Airwallex. This means you can assign costs directly to those Xero contacts when submitting expenses.EU customers can pay on the go, with Apple Pay 🇪🇺Our customers in the EU can now connect their Airwallex Employee Cards to Apple Pay, for borderless spending on the move. Give your employees a virtual card to use while travelling, entertaining or attending events.

So, rather than storing a customer’s card details, you can simply store their network token and enable one-click checkout without running the risk of card data leaks.Because network tokens are managed by card networks, you can use the same token for a customer even if their card details have changed due to card loss or expiry. So your customers won’t need to go to the trouble of updating their card details when they pay you.Keep on top of expenses 💳Want to know how much the bar tab came to at that client event three months ago? Well, now you can. You can now filter your Airwallex expenses by date, and easily check how budget was spent on any given day, week or month.   Admins can also now archive expenses that they don’t want to process through Airwallex. If, for example, you have already processed an expense directly in Xero and don’t want to process it twice, you can archive it.   Enhance security with restricted API keys 🔒 For those not in the know, API keys allow developers and calling programs to access Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Restricted API keys allow you to choose which APIs each user has access to, giving you an added layer of security when building with Airwallex APIs. Upcoming arrivals 🧳Next on our roadmap, we'll be updating our Expenses feature. Don't want to waste time approving every coffee round? You'll be able to adjust your settings so that expenses under a certain threshold don't need approval. We'll also be adding multi-layer approvals so you can set up custom workflows for larger expenses. Keep an eye on our upcoming release notes to find out more. That’s the end of our September release round-up. We hope these improvements help you kickstart Q4 the right way. Have something you’d like to see earlier for your region on our roadmap?

You can grow your customer base, take advantage of favourable foreign market conditions, increase your revenue and more.
But making the leap from domestic to international sales can seem daunting. If you’re wondering how to sell online internationally, Shopify is a great place to start.
Let’s take a look at why Shopify lends itself to global eCommerce and how to sell on Shopify overseas.Why sell internationally with Shopify?Shopify provides a number of features that make it easy to sell globally. 
Note: Not all Shopify plans offer the same features. Be sure to check out and compare their various plans before making a purchase.Simple currency conversionsAccording to Shopify-collected data, adjusting product prices to international customers’ local currencies increases conversion rates by up to 40%. This comes as no surprise: Customers want to know how much they’ll end up paying in their own currency — without going through the trouble of converting prices themselves.
🛒Top tip: Plug Airwallex into your Shopify checkout and accept multi-currency payments without unnecessary fees. Collect international customer payments directly into your Airwallex Global Account without being forced to convert funds to your home currency. Then pay out to international suppliers using Borderless Cards and Transfers. 

TranslationYou probably know from personal experience that reading product descriptions in a foreign language doesn’t make for the best customer experience.
The numbers back this up: 40% of global consumers won’t buy products that are marketed in a foreign language, according to a Common Sense Advisory research series. And 65% prefer content in their native language.
The bottom line is clear — if you don’t provide translations, you’re shooting yourself in the foot.
International domainsShopify helps you go even further in your localisation efforts with international domains. 
International domains not only make it easier to localise currencies and languages but also enable you to improve your search engine optimisation (SEO) by geotargeting. For those of you who aren’t SEO experts, that means delivering different content to visitors from different locations.
Furthermore, you have the option to choose either a country domain or a subdomain, which makes targeting a specific country or market even easier. Local payment methodsOne of the most effective ways to earn potential customers’ trust and facilitate purchases is to offer their preferred payment methods. 
After all, if they don’t have — or it’s inconvenient to use — the required payment method, you’ve likely lost a sale. On the other hand, offering preferred payment methods can increase your conversions when you sell products abroad.
🛒Top tip: The Airwallex Shopify integration allows you to offer multiple local payment methods on your website. Including Alipay, WeChat Pay, Klarna, Union Pay and more. Increase global sales by allowing your customers to pay you the way they want, wherever they are. Taxes and feesConcerns about additional taxes or fees are one of the biggest obstacles for buyers looking to purchase from a foreign site. 
Buyers want and need to know whether the total on the checkout page is the amount that the shop will charge their card. And confusion surrounding this can cause everything from lost sales to chargebacks.
Shopify international sites collect duty and import taxes directly at checkout. Customers will enjoy complete clarity into their total cost, and you can be sure that your shop complies with local requirements.
[Related: What are my legal considerations before expanding overseas?]Customisable market configurations and smart settingsWorried about managing your site after you expand? Shopify simplifies the process by letting you manage all your settings across markets from a single place.
At the same time, Shopify provides data and insights from past customer behaviour to help you make informed decisions. Review your business’s current performance in your selected markets and optimise to improve your international success.Custom market-specific pricing controlsProfit margins can be difficult to measure when you sell products abroad in multiple markets. After all, factors such as duties, taxes and shipping vary from one country to the next.
As a result, you’ll likely need to develop different pricing strategies for different markets.
Shopify makes this easy with custom international pricing controls. Make percentage-based adjustments by market, or product-specific changes — whatever makes the most sense to increase your margins.
🛒Top tip: Manage all your funds in one place with an Airwallex Global Account. Open 11 foreign currency accounts in a click and collect customer payments from around the world into a single multi-currency wallet.Market-specific inventory and fulfilment If you plan on selling in various markets, chances are you’ll have to store inventory in multiple locations. 
Luckily, Shopify’s Markets feature makes it easy to display only the inventory that you can ship to the country that the customer is located in. 
For instance, imagine you have a UK location that ships across Europe and a US location that ships within North America. Your European visitors will see only the inventory available at your UK location.
This may sound overly simple, but it can go a long way towards preventing logistics complications.
[Related: The definitive eCommerce international expansion guide]How much does it cost to sell internationally with Shopify?Shopify charges a set monthly fee in addition to credit card and transaction fees. These costs depend on the plan you choose.
Sources: Basic, Shopify and Advanced Plans; Shopify Plus Plan; Currency Conversion Fees
You can sell internationally with any of these plans. All provide features like international market management, country-specific domains, language translation, currency conversion and local payment methods.
However, certain plans are better geared towards international selling. 
For example, with the Shopify plan and above, you can set custom rounding rules for your prices per market — such as having all your UK prices end in £0.99 and all your EUR prices end in €0.90.
The Advanced plan offers even more benefits, such as market-specific pricing and duty and import tax collection, which give customers greater clarity into their total cost.
Also keep in mind that you’ll enjoy lower credit card rates and external transaction fees with each plan upgrade.
[Related: The best payment gateways for international eCommerce]How to reduce international Shopify feesNow that you know how much selling international products on Shopify might cost you, let’s look at how you can reduce your fees.
You can’t exactly get around the costs associated with your Shopify plan, credit card rates or transaction fees, but conversion fees are a different story. Shopify itself best explains how these fees work:
When you accept payment in a currency that is different from your payout currency, then a currency conversion occurs. The amount that you receive in your customer's local currency (also referred to as the presentment currency) is converted to your payout currency, and you’re charged a currency conversion fee.
To avoid conversion fees on Shopify international payments, you need to avoid having to convert your funds in the first place. You have two options to do this.
One option is to set up a local bank account in each country you plan to sell in.
For example, imagine you’re a UK business that wants to sell in France. You open a local euro bank account and connect it to your Shopify account. Now, whenever you make sales in France, you send the revenue directly to your new euro bank account — effectively avoiding conversion fees.
The downside of this option is that banks also charge high conversion fees (up to 3.5%) as well as transfer fees. So, although you may postpone additional charges, you’ll eventually have to pay them when you’re ready to transfer funds back to the UK. Banks also charge monthly account fees, so any money you save could end up being cancelled out by excess bank charges.
Luckily, you have another option: to open a Global Business Account with Airwallex.
Airwallex Global Business Accounts enable you to collect Shopify international payments in multiple currencies — including pound sterling, euros, USD and more — from your Shopify account into a single multi-currency account. No forced currency conversions or transfer fees apply.
You can hold funds in your multi-currency account for as long as you want, and use them to pay international suppliers, VAT bills and SaaS subscriptions, all whilst avoiding FX fees.  
If you do want to convert funds into your local currency, we charge only 0.5–1% above the interbank exchange rate. That’s significantly lower than Shopify, which charges 2% outside the US, and the high street banks, which charge 2–3.5% above the interbank rate.
As a result, your business could save thousands, depending on your sales volume. And you can do all this without dealing with multiple foreign banks or a complicated payment instructure. Instead, manage your money from a single central account.

[Related: How to transfer money to an international bank account]How to identify new marketsOnce you decide you want to sell internationally, you have to decide where.
Remember that you want to provide a shopping experience that’s tailored to each specific market, so selling anywhere and everywhere would be a massive undertaking. Furthermore, your product offerings are likely more attractive to certain markets.
To narrow your options, start by visiting Shopify’s analytics section to check out your “sessions by location” acquisitions report. This report shows you which countries your visitors are from.
Do you already have some visitors — or even sales — from a specific country? That’s a great indication of demand for your products from that international market. You should take a closer look at it.
Don’t worry if you don’t yet have any international visitors — that doesn’t mean selling internationally isn’t viable. Instead, look for markets that seem like they could have strong demand for your products. Explore markets in countries with these attributes: Share the same language as youAre close to you in proximity Have cultural similaritiesShow similar purchasing habitsWith these tips in mind, settle on one to two new markets to expand to.How to fulfil your products abroadSelling international products involves more than just setting up your website to target a new market. Before making sales, you must be prepared to deliver products to international customers. 
Fulfiling your products involves three main steps:Importing. Shipping individual products to foreign customers from your original warehouse probably doesn’t make sense if you’re working with a considerable volume. Instead, import products directly to your new market areas to reduce shipping costs and times. Just be sure you have the paperwork needed to get your products past customs. Storing. Be sure to shop around for a reliable (and cost-effective) warehouse or storage unit to hold your inventory. And remember that Shopify offers market-specific fulfilment controlsthat let you source products from select inventory locations for select markets.Shipping. The question isn’t so much, “Does Shopify ship internationally?” — it’s more a question of how! Shopify Shipping makes it easy to deliver orders by letting you purchase international shipping labels directly from your account and automatically generating the correct customs forms for you. Shopify also partners with local carriers in your area (DPD and Evri in the UK) to facilitate delivery.[Related: The ultimate guide to paying overseas suppliers]How to improve your global sales on ShopifySo, you know how to sell products on Shopify, and you’re ready to get started. How do you ensure your efforts succeed?Localise, localise, localiseIf you’ve made it this far, you already know why localisation is essential to your international expansion and how Shopify facilitates the process. But let’s look again at the most important steps:Translate your content. Customers strongly prefer to purchase products in their native language. Ensure all text (from your product descriptions to your landing pages) is translated to create an ideal customer experience.List local currencies. Don’t make customers do conversions themselves — update product prices to reflect their local currency, and collect multi-currency payments directly into your Airwallex Global Account using our seamless Shopify integration. Offer local payment methods. Simplify the checkout process for customers and increase conversions by offering local payment methods. Airwallex makes this easy: With our Shopify integration, you can offer multiple local payment methods at your checkout, including WeChat, Alipay and Skrill.Create international domains. Take your localisation even further with international domains to target certain markets.Be aware of local holidaysSales typically spike during specific shopping periods throughout the year, but don’t assume those periods will be the same in your new markets.
For example, Black Friday and Christmas dominate in the West, but sales peak on Single’s Day across Asia.
Failing to note these shopping habit differences can cause inventory shortages or overages — not to mention missed opportunities. Use our global eCommerce calendar to make sure your business doesn’t miss out.AdvertiseA strategic marketing plan is essential to ensure all your website localisation efforts don’t go to waste. What’s the point of having a targeted website if no one sees it?
And just like with choosing new target markets, remember that one size doesn’t fit all with marketing. Develop market-specific advertising campaigns that target buyers in that area and direct them to the appropriate version of your website. Take your eCommerce business global with Shopify and AirwallexIf you’re ready to sell globally and want to simplify your expansion, Shopify may be the way to go. Take advantage of Shopify’s many features geared towards international selling to quickly expand your base.
And to further simplify the finance side, Airwallex is ready to help you collect payments in local currencies, localise your checkout, and cut down fees.

Although it’s a relative newcomer, it’s gaining momentum as a payment service. It often appears as a checkout option next to common payment services like PayPal. After all, Amazon’s general approach is to conquer every corner of the market.
So, what is Amazon Pay, and how does Amazon Pay work? 
[Related: How to sell internationally on Amazon from the UK]What is Amazon Pay?In sum, Amazon Pay lets customers purchase goods with the information already in their Amazon account (e.g. credit card, debit card, address). Like Apple Pay and PayPal, customers’ information appears across sites and accounts when the service is available. Customers can also make Amazon online payments using Alexa.
For eCommerce small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), Amazon Pay provides an avenue to easily process customer payments. In 2021, the service became available to sellers in multiple European countries, including the UK.
[Related: How your online business can accept Apple Pay]How does Amazon Pay work?Amazon Pay works by using the payment information in customers’ existing Amazon accounts. When Amazon Pay is available for a transaction, customers simply click “Amazon Pay” and follow basic prompts.
However, eCommerce SMBs need to set up the service to process Amazon payments on their specific platform. Here are the main steps you’ll need to take to set up Amazon Pay as a seller:Create an Amazon Seller account.Add Amazon Pay as a payment option on your eCommerce platform.Accept security and payment terms from your platform and Amazon Pay.Configure settings so that Amazon Pay and your eCommerce platform work together.Place the Amazon Pay option on your checkout page (you’ll use a plugin or code).Run a test to make sure Amazon Pay works on your eCommerce platform.If you want to add Amazon Pay as an option and your SMB already sells on Amazon, simply log in and change your accepted payment settings. Amazon offers two helpful videos. 
Like most other online payment services, Amazon Pay uses tokenisation to ensure Amazon payments are secure. With tokenisation, customers’ sensitive data becomes “tokens” — or substitute data — instead of the actual sensitive information.
[Related: The best D2C platforms for international eCommerce]What are the Amazon Pay costs?
As with all payment gateways, eCommerce businesses are charged a fee for accepting payments through Amazon Pay.
When a customer pays you via Amazon Pay, you will be charged an authorisation fee and a processing fee. These fees differ according to whether the transaction is domestic or international (aka “cross-border”).
Here’s what you’ll pay in fees for US (domestic) Amazon online payments: 
For online and mobile, 2.9% + 30¢ per transactionFor Alexa voice, 4% + 30¢ per transaction 
Here’s what you’ll pay in fees for cross-border (international) payments:For online and mobile, 3.9% + 30¢ per transactionFor Alexa voice, 5% + 30¢ per transactionIn essence, you’ll pay an additional 1% for international/cross-border transactions. You can check out Amazon Pay’s full fees table for more clarification.Additionally, if you are accepting payments in multiple currencies and you need to use Amazon's Currency Converter, you'll be charged up to 3.9% for FX. 
[Related: How to price and promote your product for international markets]Amazon Pay: Pros and consLike any other payment system, Amazon Pay has advantages and disadvantages. Let’s examine them further so you’ll know what to expect.ProsOne advantage of using Amazon Pay for your eCommerce SMB is the size of Amazon’s customer base. The Amazon Shopping app alone had 98.07 billion monthly users in 2021, and eCommerce sales continue to grow. 
Amazon Pay also partners with Magento, BigCommerce and Zuora, so platform integrations are usually easy. Its portal for SMBs offers helpful, step-by-step guidance.
Moreover, with its A-to-Z Guarantee, Amazon Pay is a secure method of sending and receiving payments. ConsOf course, the fees that Amazon Pay charges are a major disadvantage, particularly if you process many international transactions. 
The seller verification process also may be complicated, requiring multiple documents and tax information.
Amazon Pay doesn’t work with some platforms, typically those offering competing payment systems (e.g. Wix, Squarespace).
Additionally, some SMBs have noted integrating Amazon Pay onto their platform can be more complex than Amazon implies.Amazon Pay pros vs. cons: TakeawaysIf your SMB already sells on Amazon, setting up Amazon Pay is fairly simple. You can start processing an Amazon payment as soon as Amazon verifies your eligibility.
Once your SMB integrates Amazon Pay onto its platform, customers can make Amazon online payments easily. The “Amazon Pay” button may add credibility as customers recognise the Amazon logo.
If you can wade through the paperwork and pay the international transaction fees, Amazon Pay may be a good option. However, if your SMB processes cross-border transactions regularly, Amazon Pay’s fees can stack up.
[Related: The best online marketplaces for selling your products internationally]Alternatives to Amazon PayAmazon Pay is one of many payment gateways you can add to your eCommece checkout in order to ensure a smooth payment journey for your customers. Other options include: Apple PayGoogle PayPayPalAlipaySkrillWePayGrabPayThe payment methods you choose to offer on your site can significantly affect your conversion rates. In fact, 20% of cart abandonments are due to a lack of relevant payment methods on merchant sites, according to research from PPRO.
The right payment methods for your site will depend on where you’re selling. According to a recent Airwallex report on cross-border eCommerce, the most popular payment methods in the US include Afterpay, Splitit, Klarna and Venmo. Whilst in China, the most popular payment methods are Alipay, UnionPay and WeChat Pay. 
With this in mind, the best course of action a global eCommerce business can take is to localise their checkout to suit each market they expand into. 
Here’s where Airwallex can help. 

We make it possible for eCommerce businesses to offer their customers multiple payment options. So wherever your customers are, they can pay you the way they want. 
Simply plug our software into your business’ online checkout, and instantly offer 60+ local payment options worldwide. These payment options include Alipay, Grab Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay and many more.  
Like Amazon, Airwallex uses tokenisation to ensure your customers’ card data is kept safe, and our software integrates seamlessly with leading eCommerce platforms such as Shopify, Magento and WooCommerce.  
Using local payment methods is cheaper, too. Particularly when you factor in Amazon's additional cross-border fees. For example, Alipay charges just 0.55%. 
What’s more, once you’ve signed up to Airwallex, you can collect multiple currencies into your Global Business Account without being forced to convert funds to your home currency. What this means in practice is that you can collect foreign currencies — including USD, CNY, EUR, GBP and more — from your global customers, hold those funds in your account, and use them to pay suppliers, SaaS subscriptions and other business expenses without paying any FX fees. 
And if you need to exchange currencies, you can do so at our market-leading FX rate of 0.5 - 1%. That’s significantly cheaper than Amazon's FX fees which can be up to 3.9% when you exchange on Amazon’s Currency Converter.

But what exactly is it, and why is it important? We’ll explore both questions, explain the eight types of MRR and discuss why you should track them.What is monthly recurring revenue (MRR)?Monthly recurring revenue is the income that a business can rely on gaining over one month. It represents stable, regular and predictable earnings. 
MRR is a method of averaging your pricing plans (variable or not) and billing periods so that you have a consistent number to track over time. When you track it, you can discover trends and learn where and how your business can improve financially.
Your MRR creates a correlation between customers and their accounts, and it can even shed light on their subscription behaviour.
For example, a rise in MRR indicates you’re gaining more customers, subscription plan upgrades or perhaps both. Alternatively, a fall in MRR indicates subscription cancellations, downgrades and churn. 
[Related: How to calculate cash burn rate the right way!]How to calculate monthly recurring revenue (MRR)You use MRR to predict the total amount of revenue that your business generates from active subscriptions in one month.
This includes active charges to existing subscriptions, as well as discounts, recurring add-ons, coupons and more. However, it excludes one-time fees. 
Calculating your recurring monthly revenue is easy. You simply multiply your current number of monthly customers (or subscribers) by the average revenue per user (ARPU). 
Knowing your MRR helps you understand your business’s overall financial status and predict future earnings (or areas you can improve to potentially earn more money). 
Here’s the monthly recurring revenue formula: 
MRR = Number of monthly subscribers x ARPU
A monthly recurring revenue example might look something like this. If you have 45 subscribers who pay an average of USD250 per month, your MRR is USD11,250. 
To find your annual recurring revenue (ARR), simply multiply your MRR by 12.
Here’s the annual recurring revenue formula:
ARR = MRR × 12 
Working off the MRR calculated above (USD11,250), if you multiply that value by 12, your ARR is USD135,000.
[Related: Net working capital: How to calculate it and why it’s important]Types of MRR and how to calculate themTo understand why your MRR may be falling or rising, you must understand and track the different factors that go into the metric. 
You can do this by breaking down MRR into different types. Each type offers its own insights into customer behaviour, revenue and your business’s general growth and profitability. 
Let’s explore the different types of MRR. New MRRNew MRR is any additional revenue you gain from new customers within one month.
For example, let’s say your business gets seven new subscriptions that each cost USD125 per month. You can calculate your new MRR by multiplying 7 by USD125. The result is USD875.Upgrade MRRUpgrade MRR is similar to new MRR in that it considers any additional revenue gain within one month. However, upgrade MRR is based on existing subscription plans bumping up to premium ones that cost more money per month. 
You should also consider any subscription add-ons when calculating your upgrade MRR. 
For example, if an existing customer has a basic subscription plan that costs USD35 per month and upgrades to a premium plan that costs USD90 per month, the upgrade MRR is USD55. Customers with basic subscription plans who apply for premium ones as well as add-ons would look something like this (depending on your prices):Upgrade MRR = (premium plan subscription cost - basic subscription plan cost) + subscription add-on priceDowngrade MRRDowngrade MRR is the amount of revenue that’s decreased because a customer moved from an existing, higher-cost subscription plan to a lower-cost monthly subscription plan. 
A customer who downgrades from a premium subscription plan to a basic plan will reduce your MRR. For example, if your premium plan costs USD150 per month and your basic plan costs USD80 per month, your downgrade MRR is USD70. Expansion MRR Expansion MRR is any additional revenue you gain from existing customers from one month to the next. In other words, it’s a specified month’s revenue compared to the previous month’s revenue. The difference is your expansion revenue — it will always be a positive value. 
Most businesses see expansion MRR from subscription add-ons, cross-selling and/or upselling services and/or products. 
A positive expansion MRR indicates your business is retaining customers and thus developing a loyal customer base. This is great for your business — your bottom line (overall revenue) is increasing because you’re gaining more money from existing customers without spending money trying to attract them. 
High customer acquisition cost (CAC) ultimately lowers your bottom line. 
Here’s how to calculate your monthly expansion MRR percentage:
Expansion MRR = (Revenue for specified month ÷ Total MRR at the beginning of the month) x 100Reactivation MRRReactivation MRR is your monthly revenue gained from previous customers who returned to a paid plan. It’s related to churn rate. Your reactivation MRR is the profit you earn from lost customers who return.
For example, if 10 of your lost or churned customers reactivate accounts that cost USD35 per month, your reactivation MRR for that month is 10 x USD35, which equals USD350. Contraction MRRContraction MRR is the amount of revenue your business loses from subscription downgrades and cancellations within one month. 
Customers pausing subscriptions, paying for subscriptions with credits rather than money, using discounts or maybe stopping add-ons that they previously had all factor into contraction MRR. 
This might seem awfully similar to downgrade MRR, but the difference is that contraction MRR takes into account other reasons your monthly revenue may decrease. Downgrade MRR focuses solely on money lost due to downgrading a subscription plan for a lower-cost one. 
For example, perhaps you offer a 50% one-time monthly discount to 20 of your most loyal customers. Each customer’s monthly cost will likely vary, but let’s say they all have a premium subscription plan that costs USD80 per month. You can find your contraction MRR by taking these steps:Take 50% off your premium subscription plan cost: 50% (or 0.5) x USD80 = USD40.Multiply that value (USD40) by the number of customers you’re giving a discount to: (USD40 x 20 customers = USD800). Note that your contraction MRR is USD800 for that month.Churn MRRChurn MRR is the revenue your business loses from subscription cancellations within one month.
For example, maybe 12 customers who pay USD200 per month for their subscriptions end up cancelling. Your churn MRR for that month is 12 x USD200 = USD2,400. Net new MRRNet new MRR is the amount of revenue that’s increased or decreased within one month compared to the previous month. 
Here’s the net new MRR formula:
Net new MRR = (new MRR + expansion MRR) – churn MRR
A negative net new MRR means the sum of your new MRR and expansion MRR is less than your churn MRR. Unfortunately, you’ve lost revenue for that month. Alternatively, if your net new MRR is positive, you’ve gained revenue. 
For example, in one month, you may have gained 10 new customers who signed up for basic subscription plans that cost USD80 per month. Additionally, 12 of your existing customers may have upgraded their USD80 per month plan to a premium plan that costs USD150 per month. However, six of your other existing customers who had the USD150 per month subscriptions cancelled their plans. 
You can calculate your monthly net new MRR by following these steps:Multiply the 10 new customers by USD80, which equals USD800.Multiply the 12 existing customers by the cost difference of their older, lower-cost plan, compared to their more expensive, premium subscription plan. In this case, 12 x (USD150-USD80) = USD840.Add the totals from steps one and two. So, (USD800 + USD840) = USD1,640. Multiply the number of customers who churned by the cost of their cancelled subscriptions. In this case, 6 churned customers x USD150 per month = USD900.Take your total from step three and subtract the total from step four: USD1,640 - USD900 = USD740.Note that your net new MRR is USD740.How to analyse MRRMost business owners and employees know it’s important to offer quality products and services. Along with great customer service, this is what keeps customers around longer. You can’t retain customers if they aren’t happy with their purchase(s) and/or the help you give them. 
However, it’s equally important to monitor your financial metrics. In the SaaS business, MRR is one of the most important metrics to pay attention to. 
You usually base SaaS monthly recurring revenue on subscriptions. New customers are always signing up, and existing customers are consistently either upgrading or cancelling their subscriptions. This causes revenue fluctuation, which isn’t always a negative thing in the long run. 
Analysing your MRR helps you capture why, where and how much your revenue fluctuates. It allows you to discover areas of your business that you could improve. 
Simply calculating your regular monthly revenue is misleading and hardly helpful because it doesn’t consider changes in subscription plans (which are common). 
MRR makes it easy to analyse your business’s financial health and predict future revenue. Ultimately, you can make smarter decisions when it comes to investing, budgeting and scaling your business to grow.
[Related: Determining payback periods: How to plan for startup success]Why is tracking MRR important for your business?Let’s take a closer look at the specific areas that MRR tracks and why they’re important to monitor. BudgetingMRR represents current and future monthly revenue and growth. When you have an accurate idea of your monthly earnings, you can better decide where to reinvest and save. 
MRR also pinpoints business areas that could benefit from more (or fewer) resources, such as more employees to handle customer service. Tracking performanceOne month is a reasonable amount of time to measure your business’s subscription growth. By comparison, one week is too short for anything substantial to happen (or measure), and one year is too long. 
The monthly recurring revenue model recognises smaller amounts of revenue that gradually come in. Knowing your business has a steady flow of income ensures your operations are sustainable. But to know this, you must first examine your MRR. 
It shows your month to month-to-month trends and provides valuable insights into your business’s financial health (e.g. meeting quotas). 
Plus, periodically looking at your MRR throughout a year helps you set long-term goals. Forecasting revenueTo make accurate sales predictions in the short and long term, you need to look at MRR. 
Your monthly financial performance usually indicates how your business will perform in subsequent months. If your current monthly performance isn’t as strong as you’d like, you can change your sales and/or marketing efforts to improve the next month’s MRR.
[Related: How to calculate and improve ROI in easy steps]How to improve monthly recurring revenue Now that you know the different types of MRR and how to calculate them, you might be wondering how to improve your monthly recurring revenue model.
Here are a few tips to help you improve your MRR.Increase pricesOne way to increase your MRR is to increase the prices of your products and/or services. 
However, if you increase your prices, you should ensure quality goes up, too. If you don’t, loyal customers might wonder why they paid less in the past for the same-quality goods and services. 
But how do you improve quality? It doesn’t necessarily require making something “shinier.” It means incorporating more attentive customer service or even adding more (or better) features to your subscription services. 
Note: Make sure to always notify customers of price increases. If you don’t, you could lose them. Worse, you could face legal consequences. Offer different plansAnother way to improve your MRR is to offer differently priced plans. 
Some businesses have a free, basic product. But if a customer upgrades their plan to premium, they’ll get several more features at their fingertips. 
Having different plans offers variety. Customers will enjoy freedom to choose what works best for them, depending on what features you include in each distinct plan. 
However, ensure you include your business’s most valuable features in the highest-priced plan. Create upsell opportunitiesUpselling is one of the greatest ways to improve your MRR because it exposes customers to better features or premium plans that they could switch to. 
As mentioned, it’s beneficial to have different priced plans — when you have variety, it’s easier to find upsell opportunities. 
For example, your basic plan might offer 10 free project accounts. But when a customer eventually reaches that cap and needs more project space, it creates an ideal opportunity for you to upsell a premium plan and thus make more money. Retain more customers
Fine-tuning your retention strategy will do wonders for your recurring revenue. When you retain a higher number of customers, you increase your loyal customer base while also reducing customer acquisition cost (CAC). That’s because you’re putting effort into making your loyal customers happy rather than attracting new ones!
Here are some ways to improve customer retention:Create a loyalty programOffer promotionals deals, discounts and bonus perks Improve your customer care and customer relationship management (CRM)Pay attention to customersAnother way to improve MRR is to listen to customers. They typically know exactly what they want, so why not speak to them directly?
Try implementing a customer feedback system so you can get direct input from your customer base. Once you gain a better idea of customers’ wants and needs, you can make improvements that actually make a difference when it comes to your MRR.Pursue more leadsTo improve your MRR, try looking back at your original marketing plan. 
When you go back to the drawing table — while comparing what currently is and isn’t working well — you can pinpoint where and how to tweak your strategy. A better strategy will help you gain (and retain) more leads. 
For instance, your business may have a greater budget as it’s grown over the months or years. If that’s the case, you can likely afford new marketing tactics.Scale your SaaS business across borders with AirwallexIf you’re ready to streamline your finances and improve your profit margins, sign up for a Global Business Account with Airwallex.

The US has the second largest market with a value of USD 103.9 billion, and the UK has the third largest market with a value of USD 30.5 billion. Despite this, the percentage of online shoppers in China and the US who have bought items from international retailers remains relatively small. In China, just 39% of online shoppers have shopped cross border, whilst in the US just 33% of online shoppers have done so. By contrast, 84% of online shoppers in Israel, 83% in Austria, and 78% in Singapore have bought from international eCommerce sites in the past. Arguably, this gives the China and US markets room for significant expansion over the coming years as cross border shopping grows in popularity. Tristan Chiappini, Vice President, Partnerships, and head of APAC at PPRO, says: “What we’re seeing is a big increase in cross border eCommerce shopping. The size of the eCommerce pie is not dictated any more by the size and growth of your domestic market. Now the world is your oyster, you’re able to tap into that growth in multiple geographies.”The research shows that the top-performing eCommerce segment in China in 2021 was toys, hobbies and DIY, with 26% of the market share. Fashion was the second highest performing category with 25% of the market share, and food and personal care came in third with 21% of the market share.  In the US, the top performing eCommerce segment was fashion with 31% of the market share. Electronics and media was the second best performing segment with 21%, and toys, hobbies and DIY was third with 20%.eCommerce businesses looking to expand into new markets in 2022 and beyond should consider optimising their online checkout by offering local payment methods that their customers know and trust. According to research from PPRO, 20% of cart abandonments are due to a lack of local payment methods on merchant checkouts. Popular payment methods in China include Alipay, UnionPay and WeChat Pay. Whilst in the US, the preferred payment methods include Afterpay, Klarna, Splitit and Venmo. Airwallex enables eCommerce businesses to increase their international conversion rates by offering customers 60+ local payment methods at checkout. Merchants can simply plug Airwallex into their online store and instantly give their customers the freedom to pay the way they want, wherever they are. Merchants can also settle in multiple currencies and collect funds directly into their Airwallex Global Account without being forced to convert funds to their home currency, helping them avoid needless FX fees and improve their profit margins. Pranav Sood, GM, Airwallex, EMEA says: “Today’s market presents a tremendous opportunity for eCommerce businesses to grow beyond borders. Airwallex is facilitating that expansion by providing businesses with the financial infrastructure they need to accept multi-currency payments without high fees, and offer the local payment methods their customers trust. With our technology in place, eCommerce businesses can increase international conversion rates, improve their profit margins and achieve exponential growth.”   Research conducted by Edgur Dunn & Company, data taken from global eCommerce sales in 2021.

Today I'm talking to Shannon Lincoln, the CFO of Oyster HR. Shannon and the team at Oyster built a unicorn in just over two years, scaling the team and product at a rapid pace.

Shannon also shares her tips on how startups can build a diverse workforce. We'll also talk about how Oyster hires executives, which is a notoriously difficult thing to do in fast-growing startups.It's not easy to be a CFO in this difficult, macroeconomic environment. Shannon shares some of her tips to help navigate startups through this turmoil. All of this and more right now on the Launch Lessons Podcast. I'd love to start with just an introduction to you, Oyster, and what you've been up to in the past year and a half.Shannon Lincoln (01:01):Great. Thank you for having me. Excited to be here. So I'm Shannon Lincoln. I'm the CFO of Oyster. Currently in San Francisco, originally from Toronto. And Oyster has been on a pretty incredible growth journey over the past 18 months or so. We're a global employment platform, so we are on a mission to create a more equal world by letting companies everywhere hire people anywhere. And we went from a seed stage company about 18 months ago to a series C company in April this year. So it's been a wild ride.Sam Kothari (01:37):I'm sure. I think going through that kind of growth, I'm sure there's a lot of challenges and opportunities that have been unlocked as part of that growth journey. And that's something I'd definitely love to dig into. But before we start going into your journey with Oyster, I'd love to understand how you ended up in this high growth tech space because obviously I think you started out your life in Canada and then moved into consulting. But maybe talk us through what drew you from the professional services space into working in these high growth environments.Shannon Lincoln (02:08):So I was actually an auditor at PWC. So, a little less exciting than the consulting side. But I wanted to switch to the other side and really be part of building something as opposed to coming in every year and checking and pointing out what had gone wrong and trying to fix that. So I moved to the Bay Area about seven years ago and joined a startup right after their series A. And let's say I got addicted to company building and seeing the impact that the financial experience that I had could have on an early stage company with a very fast feedback loop, especially working with others who didn't necessarily have that financial perspective. I found it pretty exciting to see the changes that we could make so quickly, and the impact that can have on growth.Sam Kothari (02:59):Were there any major lessons or take-aways from your journey at PWC? Because you spent a fair bit of time there. I think six years. So any of those lessons outside of obviously the technical skills I'm sure you would have picked up that you would have been deploying in your roles post PWC?Shannon Lincoln (03:16):I guess I would say, at the end of the day I think it's always about the people. That was true as far as me joining PWC as opposed to other firms, and also as far as the clients. We always had the best results when we had a team that was really on the same page, and the communication was flowing. So I would say that's always the first step that I look to is the people.And from there you can achieve a lot, you can resolve differences in opinion. You can get everyone marching in the same direction around a common goal, and then, like you said, I think the technical was a prerequisite as well and not to be ignored. But I think the relationships that you build with the people you're working with are probably the most important thing, and that's the hardest part to get right as well.Sam Kothari (04:04):I wanted to share a little recommendation that I found on your LinkedIn. This is from 2015. But it's definitely one of the most glowing recommendations I've ever seen in my life. And so I wanted to quote a little bit and really try and understand what makes you tick and whether there were experiences that were foundational to your approach and style in your professional life. We'll obviously link to your LinkedIn profile in our show notes. But I recommend everyone have a read.But some quotes from that recommendation, ""Shannon asks all the right questions. She gets information from you in a manner that you realize you know a lot more than you think. She makes you feel confident after every conversation. She taught me the value of asking the right questions. She talks so little. She listens a lot. And when she talks, it is so well paid for the time you waited. And she dares to make great decisions and makes them with 100% confidence.""That's obviously a wonderful recommendation from a former colleague. And it's one that I hope I can get as well on my LinkedIn. But help me understand where that style and approach has come from.Shannon Lincoln (05:13):Yeah, I would say you're definitely cherry picking. But that was actually from a client as opposed to a colleague, who I worked really closely with and helped through some tough challenges. We had a pretty close relationship. So I guess I would say  I don't know if it's a Canadian thing, but I usually default to listening and figuring out what other people know before sharing what I know. And I think that's important. I think it lets me come into conversations with confidence because I've heard the other side of it first.And I think you figure things out much faster that way as opposed to coming in assuming you're the smartest person in the room. I think it's always better to assume that you're the dumbest person in the room and then add the pieces that you can add. I think if everyone took that approach, you would end up better off. You might be a little slower to start, but I think everyone's got a little piece of something to add. And they should be able to add it.Sam Kothari (06:25):How do you think about that approach in a leadership context? Because I'm sure the Oyster team would be looking at you as the CFO, senior executive, expecting you to come into discussions with strong views and strong opinions. So how do you balance that now that you're in quite a senior leadership role?Shannon Lincoln (06:59):I think that's a great point. I think, one, you have to hire people that you trust. And I heard, I think it was Patrick Collison, say something in an interview that when you hire someone, you want to be sure that if someone is wrong, you're just as likely to think it's you who's wrong as the person you're talking to. So I think the first step is hiring the right people where you can really trust that they're going to do things in the right way.And then I think  as I become more senior, I think I've learned that it's more about setting the high level of direction and then letting the team really bring the experiences from the field and being able to run with it. And I think letting them lead gets you to a better answer in the end that's not the exact way you would do it. I think the ownership that the team takes is going to balance any differences in the way that you would have approached a situation if you did it personally.Sam Kothari (07:42):Makes sense. So let's talk about the Oyster journey. What drew you to joining Oyster, especially in a senior role at a very early stage?Shannon Lincoln (07:53): So, the recruiter who asked me to join Oyster reached out with a Loom video on LinkedIn. And usually I ignore recruiter messages, but I had to watch it. My interest was piqued. And then when I heard the Loom video, Oyster was a bit of a light bulb for me. It just made complete sense on so many different levels. I was a complete remote work convert from the very beginning. You couldn't drag me back into an office kicking and screaming if you tried. So, to me, it's inevitable that the world is going to move that way in the long run. And then the growth opportunity associated with that is huge if you believe in the future that I do.And the people is another big one, the people and the mission. So Tony is a second-time founder. And he's sort of been there, done that. And this time he's actually trying to change the world, which is not something you come across every day. And he's committed to hiring a great team of people who are really committed to that mission and purpose for the company  he's trying to build. So I can go into more of the founder story. But I think to find all three of those things in one opportunity is pretty rare.Sam Kothari (09:15):So I've read online that hiring executives into a startup is quite challenging. I think I read a stat somewhere, 50% of executive hires leave the business within 12 months. And so the hit rate seems to be not fantastic. Obviously, you and Tony have found a really positive working relationship, and you're going from strength to strength. What did you do? What did Tony do? What did the broader Oyster team do to, one, ensure that there was alignment in your styles and values, and two, that you were best positioned to be successful within the organization over a longer period of time as well?Shannon Lincoln (09:54):That’s a great question. So Tony realized the importance of hiring a strong leadership team from the very beginning. And he actually partnered with an executive search recruiter from before they were a seed stage company. So, we apply a fairly rigorous process to every exec hire that we make. There's a case study in particular that all candidates need to do, and they prepare a deck, and send a pre-read, because a lot of the work that we do is asynchronous. So it's a test of those skills, and then also a live presentation for about half an hour followed by a Q&A. And I think that's the biggest thing I would point to as far as getting that upfront alignment and making sure that people are on the same page at the same time as well testing the skills required for the job.As far as once people are hired, I think Tony applies what he calls a servant leadership style, which is all about empowering your team to really do their best. And he encourages us to push work down, and he pushes work down to us. He comes to conversations asking how he can help as opposed to handing out instructions. He sets the high-level strategic direction, and then he really allows us to take those balls and run with them. So that's the way I love to work, and I think it's been a very successful strategy.Sam Kothari (11:22):Amazing. I really like the concept of the case study that mimics your real work environment with the asynchronous practices. Interested to dive into that a little bit more. You're a remote-first company. You've got other employees all around the world. How do you manage having people in different time zones? Do you still come together? How much of the work is actually fully asynchronous? How do you balance building that culture in that remote-first way?Shannon Lincoln (11:56):So, we've got over 600 employees in about 70 different countries. And we default to asynchronous work wherever possible. So what that means is, we use long-form written communication wherever we can. And that information is public by default. So it can be consumed asynchronously by a lot of people at once. If something is better shared verbally, then we will record Loom videos explaining things and allow people to consume that asynchronously, and watch them two X, or pause it if it's no longer relevant to them.And then if we do get together for a discussion, it's just that. We're not repeating any of the information sharing that has already taken place. It's really about debating and discussing the issues. And so I think you're able to move a lot faster that way because you can do things in parallel, you're not constrained by people's overlapping synchronous availability.And the other thing that it does is, it really democratizes the decision making quite a bit because you can share that information with a lot more people and get input from a lot more people really well.Sam Kothari (13:05):How do new hires get onboarded to adapt to this way of working? Because the style still seems very new, right? It's still something people are unfamiliar with.Shannon Lincoln (13:16):So, consistent with our asynchronous approach, we have a very extensive onboarding program that's a series of Notion pages, and Loom videos that talk about all of these things that seem trivial but are really important to know. Things like putting your working hours in Slack, or best ways to use Slack, best ways to set up your calendar  and organize things. And the tools are important, but it's really about getting that alignment about the way you work that I think is more important. But I've been very pleasantly surprised by the rate at which people can onboard because all of this is written as opposed to relying on people to verbally share how the company works and how we like to work.Sam Kothari (14:08):You're still a very young company. I'm impressed by the discipline in your documentation, and the rigor that you've got even in the onboarding process. Because I know when I joined Airwallex, we were 200 people, and I don't think we had anything written down at that point. It was a lot of information in a lot of people's heads. And even today, we're still building that muscle and that habit. So was that something you had been doing from the start? How has that evolved over time?Shannon Lincoln (14:36):So, it is actually something Tony invested in very early on. Before he hired me actually, he hired a remote work consultant, who then became part of the company. And he believes we are building the product essentially. We're encouraging people to become distributed global companies, and therefore, it's our job to lead the way and model how to be the best distributed company in the world. He invested in a team, a remote work team who essentially would audit our practices, and really invest in all this documentation to make sure that we were growing really efficiently. And I think without that infrastructure, it is hard to grow as fast as we did. It's hard to grow as fast as we did even with that infrastructure. But the infrastructure definitely enabled that [inaudible 00:15:26] growth.Sam Kothari (15:27):I'd love to dive into some of those challenges. So your headcount has gone from double digits, sort of 17, 18, to I think you mentioned 600 plus now. And in probably less than two years. That's obviously a lot of new talent. The culture would have shifted and changed a lot over time. And I'd love to dig into the culture piece shortly. But I'm interested in what some of those challenges were as you were onboarding, recruiting, and growing this rapidly.Shannon Lincoln (15:54):I think the pace itself is a challenge. Like I said, the asynchronous work allows things to move more quickly. And at times, people can feel overwhelmed by the amount of information that is thrown at them. I think also even though everyone was worried that remote work would cause people to work less, what they found was that it actually caused people to work more.So, I think burnout is a real risk with this environment because there's a tendency for some people to think they always need to be on since somebody at the company is always on, literally, just because of time zones. So I think we set a good tone at the top there. Tony doesn't work on weekends. I don't receive emails on weekends. We do focus Fridays where people can sort of flex the day and take personal appointments if they need to. And we explicitly state that the expectation is that you set your own hours, and you work within those. So I think that's how we've combated that. But it's something we need to continue to work on and make sure that new joiners understand.Sam Kothari (17:01):It feels like this has been quite a deliberate journey. Even though it's been quite fast, it feels like it's been planned. You've made a lot of strategic decisions. Even now when you talked about modeling the behavior for the rest of the employees at the leadership level. What are the companies, or stories, or insights you were drawing on? What are the best practices you're leaning on to help you figure out how you want to be building Oyster?Shannon Lincoln (17:33):We talk. We make a few different analogies when we do fundraising pitches, and we talk to employees. One that Tony likes to think about is Tesla, and that they open source a lot of their technology to allow others to benefit from that. He's a big fan of that, to allow other people to become great distributed companies, because as he says, this is a movement, this is a new category we're building, and we need others to adopt this way of thinking as much as we need them to buy into Oyster specifically. And so Tesla is one that comes to mind.There's others, like Salesforce, for example. It's selling sales software obviously. And arguably, they've invested in having the best sales team in the world. They're modeling the behavior that they're selling. It’s all part of the product essentially.Sam Kothari (18:27):I'd love to chat a little bit about diversity. Oyster is, I think, quite a diverse company already. I think it's something that companies, all companies, are striving for. Because the understanding now exists in the market that diverse organizations across multiple dimensions tend to outperform and have advantages. But achieving that is difficult. I think that's not something you can fall into if you don't think about it explicitly. So how have you been thinking about that and designing your organization in a way that promotes and builds a diverse workforce?Shannon Lincoln (19:05):This is something I think is very important. You pointed to one data point about why it's important to have diverse teams, because they perform better. But I think there's lots of reasons. I think it's the representation by population argument essentially that is often applied in [inaudible 00:19:22] government.But essentially, you have a small group of people, leadership for example, making decisions on behalf of a bigger group. You want to make sure they represent the group they're making decisions on behalf of. And so we have 50% of women in leadership. The world is made up of 50% women, for example. Therefore there should be 50% of women in leadership if you follow that logic.And what Oyster does is basically take that argument three steps further by saying you shouldn't just look at it from a gender perspective, you should look at it on every relevant dimension of diversity. And essentially, our company should look like the world. And the way we enable is by global hiring. So it becomes much, much easier when you're tapping into a global talent pool and hiring people from all over the world to hit these diversity goals.There is an element of intentionality where Tony is encouraging the leadership team to hire diverse teams, and we are encouraging our managers to hire diverse teams. But a lot of it is the fact that we hire globally and that we're enabled to do that. And if you believe the talent is just as good if not better outside of the Bay Area, or wherever it is, then the rest is really just going to happen naturally.Sam Kothari (20:38):Can you talk me through some tactics you use as part of, whether it's your recruitment process or your sourcing process for talent, which allows you to make sure this is front of mind for your managers?Shannon Lincoln (20:49):So, then we post jobs... And there are practical limitations to doing this as well. Remote work is a newer concept, and so a lot of job boards like even LinkedIn and Indeed, who are investors in Oyster, don't typically let you just post a job that's labeled remote. You have to pick a location because they need to know where to advertise the job. And so that's something they're actively working on.But in the meantime, we will post four versions of the same job rack to four major cities to try and cover all the time zones and show that we are hiring anywhere. Even with that, you will tend to get more applications in those cities, because people assume we want somebody in that specific city. But I think we've got a lot of branding showing that we will hire people anywhere, and these roles are truly meant to be global or mobile. So that's one piece.And then we monitor it. It's nothing formal, but we do track the stats. We check in on that. And we will naturally try to improve them. But we'll share nudges if we're getting off track in certain areas. And Tony especially, he's really passionate about hiring in emerging markets, so he pushes that from the top.Sam Kothari (22:09):I think that's really helpful, especially I think the point you made around even the recruitment platforms today aren't actually set up to support this new world we're starting to operate in. Something to be mindful of. I'm interested in your personal journey into leadership. What are some of the difficult issues you've faced as a woman in the workforce transitioning into a senior leadership role?Shannon Lincoln (22:30):I would say two things come to mind. One is, I think I naturally Lean In, and a lot of documentation about women in the workplace, people say you can't be what you can't see. And often there are fewer women in positions of power. So, I think it's important to have mentors. I had some very influential mentors early on who really looked out for me and helped pull me up along with them. I think that's important. And then I think it's also about advocating for yourself and [inaudible 00:23:12].There are stats about how men will apply to a job if they have less than 50% of the qualifications. Women will apply when they have close to 100. I'm sure I'm getting those numbers wrong. But I think there is an element of confidence and just making sure you're being the best advocate as well, independent of whether you have those mentors and people who can help you.Sam Kothari (23:36):What advice would you give to other women around the world who are facing challenges rising into these roles?Shannon Lincoln (23:43): I think it's important to pick the right organizations in the first place and make sure that people are going to be supportive of you based on your merit, independent of your gender. Like I said, I think that it's important to advocate for yourself and make sure you're positioning yourself in the best light possible. Not to think of it as arrogance or self promotion but to think of it as what's needed in order to get attention, and to be recognized appropriately.Sam Kothari (24:21):I'd love to switch gears a little bit into talking about your role as a CFO in a fast growing startup in the midst of what feels like a market meltdown. I'm sure you're going through some interesting challenges. You've been part of  a number of fundraisers in your role at Oyster. Let’s talk a little bit about the role you've played as part of those fundraisers. What's the right partnership between a founder and a CFO going through those fundraisers? And then we can talk a little bit about the market today and how you're thinking about navigating the business through the next couple of years.Shannon Lincoln (25:00):I think in fundraising it needs to be founder-led as far as the pitch, and oftentimes the relationships as well. I think especially at the earlier stages, VCs are very much looking to build those relationships, and they want to see the founder understanding the numbers as well as the high-level story. That’s the first step. But the role of the financial support person is not to be diminished either. And I think the more that the financial role takes or shares in coming up with the narrative and the pitch, the better the outcome will be, because you need the story to align with the numbers at the end of the day. And the financial person is going to understand the numbers inside out. My biggest recommendation is that it does need to be a true partnership. They can't be disjointed pieces of the same process; they need to work together.Sam Kothari (26:14):How do you think about the projections you're putting in these decks? Now I'm not going to ask obviously what the Oyster numbers are and forecasts. But one thing I've observed, even seeing startup pitch decks, is often the goals are very ambitious and the numbers are ambitious as well. You're coming from an audit background where you've had training in modeling and financial projections and operating now in a high uncertainty environment. How do you think about your role in balancing what's realistic, what's ambitious, and really tapering, whether it's founder or investor expectations?Shannon Lincoln (26:51):I would say you need to be ambitious with your fundraising projections. It's very common to have two versions of the numbers. You have the one you show to the board, which I typically try to under promise and over deliver on. And then the fundraising forecast, which to be frank, you should not be outperforming, or else you're likely discounting the value of your company, because the VCs are going to discount it for you. So you want to make sure you're presenting projections that are as ambitious as any other projections they're going to see.At the end of the day, VCs aren't stupid either. They're not taking a blanket haircut across all forecasts. They're going to look at your actuals, and your trends, and they're going to know, to a degree, how ambitious your forecast is. So I would say you have to be careful about where you play things to the extent that you are. And there's ways to do that that are going to be more successful than others.But at the end of the day, I think it's better to understand your business. And I think the VCs are looking to you for that. They know you understand it better than anyone else. And as long as you can explain it to them and it makes sense, and you build up credibility throughout the process when you talk about your numbers, and when you show historical numbers, I think you'll get a smaller discount on your projections. So, that's also a balance.Sam Kothari (28:22):How do you help other folks in the leadership teams get close and stay close to the numbers, whether it's the founders, or marketing, product? I feel like your role, while it's focused on a particular function, helps build confidence and trust in other functions. And you definitely want founders who understand the numbers, product leaders who understand how what they're building impacts the numbers. How do you advocate and build that shared level of understanding about where the business is and where it's going?Shannon Lincoln (28:51):That’s something we've been doing even more in the current environment. I think there's more appetite for it from employees, and other departments, and something we're very happy to provide, and have been providing [inaudible 00:29:10]. So I would say the first thing is to involve the other departments in coming up with those projections in the first place and working very closely with them on that. And that's the best way to get a forecast that you're going to hit, and also to get alignment across the business and make sure everyone is moving in sync.And then I think the data is another big piece of that. And I think as much as possible, you want to have a single source of truth. And there are various ways you can do that. We have a very strong data team who have set up a very robust instance of Looker that everyone looks to as a single source of truth. And they can self service their data needs from there. So I think people are hungry for the information. And as long as you can provide it to them in a scalable way, that goes a long way in terms of keeping everyone on the same page.Sam Kothari (30:00):Let's talk about the market downturn. How has your role shifted in the last three to six months as the economy has started to take a turn?Shannon Lincoln (30:09):Like everyone, we took a step back and reran our numbers, and made sure we were being realistic, and that we have enough capital to survive [inaudible 00:30:20] our very likely to be choppy fundraising waters the next time we go out. I think those are the basics. I think the next part is, you have to be very closely monitoring your results against that point. You can't create a plan, and then stick it in a drawer, you need to realize that things are changing very quickly. And so the most agile companies are going to be the ones who survive this.So, again, back to real-time data, and dashboards, we added a few more of those, and are getting more attention now. And also, I think my role has changed in that I'm... Like you said, I'm working on providing more visibility to the numbers to fully use them for the company. So we've been very transparent with our employee base about where we are financially. Lucky that we're in a great spot because we raised funds in April before all this happened. So we couldn't have been luckier in terms of timing. And that makes it a little easier. But it's helpful to provide that comfort and share that information with employees so they can be comfortable that the business is financially sound.Sam Kothari (31:32):Your role would shift, I assume, if departments like marketing are coming to finance and saying, ""Hey, I want to go to this event."" or ""I want to sponsor this..."" A sports team or whatever it is they're looking to do. I'm not a marketing expert, so I’m not coming up with the right examples and giving my marketing colleagues the right credit. But is your team now saying no to budget requests and headcount increases? I often feel like the finance team is the one that often gets left with that difficult job of adjusting people's expectations around what's okay now in this environment versus what's not. Is that something you are going through? And if so, how are you ensuring you maintain the right relationship between your team and the other teams and departments?Shannon Lincoln (32:22):So, as much as possible, we did the upfront work to get the high-level alignment about what's happening through a series of presentations that I did to our executive team, and to the company to align on the big picture. And then I think once everyone is on the same page about that, they understand when you make changes to the amount that people are expecting to spend or the amount that we're expecting to hire over the next little bit.I would say, once we set those budgets, and yes, we are enforcing them a lot more closely than we were. We're still trying to give people as much flexibility as possible within that. So if they have a new need, we encourage them to tell us what they can trade off to support that as opposed to just send them a blanket no. At the end of the day, we don't necessarily care what it's being spent on and we trust that they are the best people to make those decisions, we're just trying to give them the high-level objectives and help them to stay within those guidelines.Sam Kothari (33:27):And then when it comes to investors are you chatting to them more regularly? Has the cadence changed? And the questions they're asking you and your team, has that shifted as well?Shannon Lincoln (33:38):We're talking to our board more frequently. They were part of the exercise that we did to make sure everyone is on the same page and aligned. I think the most important thing there is that you get good investors in the first place who are going to be supportive of you when you're doing well, when you're doing poorly. Not that we're in that position now, but who knows where everyone is going to be in two years. And I think the first step is getting good investors who can support you.And then the second step is exactly like you said, keeping them in the loop and making sure you're minimizing surprises as much as possible. So that's another thing that we do that ties into the asynchronous work. Our board meetings are mostly asynchronous where we share all of the materials, and Loom videos in advance. Our board meetings are much more about hearing the board's feedback, as opposed to these three hour marathon sessions where we're talking at them, and they may be looking at their phone or listening. It depends on what it is and what they've done on that day. So our board loves that approach, and they're very receptive to that. And so we've got a very good relationship built on discussion and two-way feedback.Sam Kothari (34:58):It's amazing that it actually extends all the way to the board meeting. I didn't realize how seriously you’re taking the asynchronous approach. And just to maybe dive a little bit more into Oyster, your platform, and the reluctance that companies today may have, or founders may have in using platforms like yours to build a distributed team. So what are some of the challenges you think founders today are running into when they think about, ""Well, maybe this might not be the right next step for me or my organization."" Because they're nervous for whatever reason?Shannon Lincoln (35:38):I think the biggest constraint there is about the time zones. And I don't blame people for not understanding how this could work. If you haven't seen it before, it's hard. So. I think that's part of it. I think some people, depending on their leadership style, might not believe that employees' work can be monitored this closely. We're very much about monitoring output instead of input. It's enabled by the remote work environment.I would say the people who come to us are generally already excited about global hiring. People often come to us with a hire in mind. And then the constraints are more about just figuring out all the logistics. How does parental leave work in Spain? How hard is it to terminate someone in France? It's a little different than at-will employment in the US. And those are more of the questions we get. And that's exactly what Oyster is designed to help with, to figure out all of that stuff for our customers and make that really easy to navigate. And we navigate as much on their behalf as possible, and then give them the information they need to make the decisions they need to make in the context of global employment.Sam Kothari (36:55):It feels like Oyster is also riding a broader macro trend, with this distributed workforce as well. And there are other companies like Oyster that are spinning up, growing and scaling just as quickly. Are there nerves internally with the competition, as more and more startups realize this is actually a space that is, one, both aligned from the macro trend perspective but also potentially highly profitable as well?Shannon Lincoln (37:25):Yes, there are a lot of players that have come into the space who have recognized the market potential and the paradigm shift. It's not something you can just spin up with a few engineers over the course of a few months.Sam Kothari (37:40):How do you think about the legacy players in this space? Because there have been payroll companies that do global payroll. Probably not with the technology first approach that you've taken. But what's their reception been? Are you seeing them start to pivot and try and push towards the space you're playing in now?Shannon Lincoln (38:04):I think like with anything, legacy players because things are done manually, there's generally more errors. I'm speaking very broadly about legacy players here, and I'm not meaning to target any specific competitor. But generally, they're seeing price pressure because we've come in, we've automated things, we're offering a lower price point. We’re seeing responses to that in terms of the competitors and their pricing. And I think also, the way that they acquire customers has traditionally been through a lot of partnerships, and I think it's going to be tough for those to continue to scale in that way. And I think we're building a new category essentially, even though there are legacy players in this space.Sam Kothari (38:48):I want to ask you a little bit about how you personally manage the role and responsibilities you have. You're navigating a 600-plus person organization through some pretty unprecedented times. What keeps you going? How do you make sure that you're not letting the doom and gloom with the macro environment get to you and make sure that you're able to bring your best self to work every day?Shannon Lincoln (39:14):I can take that a few different ways. I think remote work is also an enabler of that because we can disconnect and take time to exercise when we need to, whether it's the middle of the day or at the end of every work week. So that's another big thing. But I won't pretend that it's not stressful at the same time. And I think one thing that Tony does very well and that the employee base at Oyster really appreciates is he's very open about his feelings, whether they're excitement or anxiety. And he shares that. And I think that gives other people permission to be open at work and talk it out. And that in itself, I think, can help improve any of the negative feelings that might be coming up. So we've got a very supportive work culture. And I think that's also huge. And we encourage people to bring their whole selves to work as people say. So that's another big part of it.Sam Kothari (40:16):Amazing. Congratulations by the way, very excited for that next chapter for you. What advice would you give yourself if you could go back and talk to yourself at the start of your career? So before you joined PWC, what's one piece of advice you'd give yourself?Shannon Lincoln (40:29):I guess I would say don't shy away from the scary opportunities. They're often, I think, the places where you grow the most. And there's going to be ups and downs. But I'd rather go through those ups and downs than be at a company that's been in steady state for years and emerge on the other side not having developed very much or learned very much. So it's not all sunshine and roses, but on the whole, I'd do it again in a heartbeat, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Sam Kothari (41:08):That's amazing. And how can our listeners be helpful to you and your mission?Shannon Lincoln (41:14):I think if you're at all interested in global hiring, we can definitely put you in touch with our sales team to help you learn more. I do think that as people are looking to be more efficient with their hiring in this environment... I mean, global hiring is not something we do because it's cheaper, but the reality is that very few countries pay the same as the Bay Area in terms of salaries. And so if you're looking to manage your bottom line at the same time as growing your company, global hiring is a great way to do that. And we're very happy to help with that.Sam Kothari (41:56):And are there any pieces of content, books, or even other podcasts you think will help founders who are thinking about global hiring for the first time to really get an overview of what their company or business could look like in the future?Shannon Lincoln (42:13):I'm sure other people in the company can answer that question better than I can.

Furthermore, they hope their revenue will see improvement.
The point of investing is to excel beyond your original financial status. It can be risky, but it’s often worthwhile. 
Here, we’ll explore what a payback period is, outline investment appraisal techniques and show how they help you plan for startup success. 
[Related: Net revenue retention and 3 things every venture capitalist looks for]What is a payback period?A payback period is the time it takes to earn back the money you put into an investment. In other words, it’s the length of time required to reach a break-even point. 
Invested money is intended to be earned back — and the shorter the payback period method, the better. 
As a startup owner who’s likely under some form of financial restriction, you’ll want to aim for a shorter return period for any investment. This will give you room to make future investments that will ultimately increase your revenue.How to calculate payback periodSo, how do you work out a payback period?
Investors and other financial professionals often calculate payback periods before making investment decisions. You should know your startup’s return on investment (ROI) before investing anything. But more specifically, you should know how long it’ll take to gain back your money. 
Calculating your payback period involves determining how long it’ll take to recover any initial or overall investment-related costs. And this information is especially useful when an investor must make a quick judgement about a venture. When push comes to shove, it’s a highly reliable metric to consider before making any decision. 
Now, you might be wondering how to calculate payback period. Here’s the payback period formula:
Payback period = (the cost of your investment) ÷ (average annual cash flow)Example of payback periodTo better understand how all this works, let’s explore an example of payback period.
Imagine a business invests USD2 million into a particular project that’s expected to save its operations about USD500,000 annually. When you divide the cost of your investment (USD2 million) by your average annual cash flow savings (USD500,000), the total is 4.
Four represents the number of years it will take for you to earn back your original investment — your payback period. 
For comparison, let’s consider another example. Let’s say your company invests USD1 million, which is expected to save you around USD400,000 annually. When you divide your investment (USD1 million) by your annual cash flow savings (USD400,000), you end up with 2.5. 
This means your payback period totals two and a half years. So, based solely on a shorter payback period, the second example investment is better than the first.
So, what is a good payback period? Overall, your startup’s plan for success should involve short payback periods. The longer your payback periods are, the less desirable the investment is. 
Here’s one more example. If you buy solar panels that cost USD10,000, and your utility savings are USD200 monthly, you would save USD2,400 yearly. 
To calculate your payback period, divide your USD10,000 solar investment by USD2,400, which equals 4.2. This means your payback period is a little over four years. 
[Related: The pain-free guide to managing business expenses]Investment appraisal techniquesAnother term for investment appraisal techniques is “capital budgeting techniques.” Project capital budgeting is a main focus for corporate finance. And it’s also one of financial analysts’ key activities. 
But what is investment appraisal (i.e. capital budgeting)? It’s the process of finding the value of different investments. You can analyse your project-based investments and then compare them to determine the best value. From there, you can decide the best course of action for your startup. 
Analysts often determine payback periods to decide the value of a project and its investment. But the payback period isn’t the only useful technique to decide project and investment value. 
In fact, analysts use several appraisal techniques for project investment comparison. Each appraisal technique looks at the project from a different perspective to provide insight into its profitability.Payback period: This is the time it takes for a project to regain the cost of its original investment.Accounting rate of return: This is the net accounting profit earned from an investment. It’s presented as a percentage of a capital investment. Net present value: This is the total amount of discounted future cash flowing in and out as it relates to a project — the sum. Internal rate of return: This joins the discounted future return and the initial investment.Profitability index: This defines how much money you earn per dollar of an initial investment.Discounted payback period: This is a calculation based on your discounted future cash flow.
[Related: 10 key business metrics every startup founder needs to know] Advantages and disadvantages of payback periodThere are several advantages and disadvantages of using payback periods to determine your investment strategy. 
The main advantage of using the payback period formula is that it’s useful for your startup’s financial and capital budgeting. But you can also apply it to other industries. 
Let’s imagine your business wants to invest in a software as a service (SaaS) tool such as Xero. Before going through with this decision, you should calculate your return on investment (ROI) for the new tool. When doing so, include the purchase cost (or in this case, the monthly subscription cost) and any other costs relevant to upgrading your business’s software that may be needed. 
The payback period metric allows you to determine whether a project investment has a short or long horizon. And to benefit your startup, you can make a more informed decision on what investments to pursue without waiting too long to earn back your original investment funds. 
However, the payback period metric has disadvantages. The payback period formula allows you to make a simple and quick calculation. But it doesn’t account for any future effects, such as inflation, time value of money and any financial complexities with unequal cash flow over a particular period. 
This is where the discounted payback period comes into play. It helps people and startups account for certain shortcomings. The simple payback period formula is favourable overall, but the discounted payback period formula helps you determine whether an investment is particularly unfavourable. 
[Related: The advantages and disadvantages of retained profit]Payback period vs discounted payback periodFor clarity in this comparison, calculating a payback period is how your startup can determine when to expect recovered investment costs. So in terms of capital budget accounting, this means the time required to see an ROI that’s equal to the sum of your initial investment. 
As for the discounted payback period, this metric also determines the time needed to recover your original investment. But it also accounts for the value of your time as it pertains to money. 
Here is the discounted payback period formula:
Discounted payback period = y + abs(n) / p“y” is the period that comes after the period where cash flow becomes positive. “p” is the discounted value of cash flow in the period that cash flow is equal to or greater than zero. “abs(n)” is the absolute value of the cumulative discounted cash flow in the “y” period.So, let’s say your startup wants to pursue a project that requires USD6,000. You expect the project to earn USD2,000 per period for the next four periods. The appropriate discount rate is 5%. 
This means your discounted payback period calculation should be minus the original investment (USD6,000) in the starting period. When the next period begins, you add USD2,000 (this is the cash inflow). 
You then take the current interbank rate (USD2.83 for the US as of now) and divide it by your expected period return. So, USD2,000 divided by USD2.83 equals USD706.71. 
After the first period, your project requires USD6,000 minus USD706.71. Therefore, you need USD5,293.29 to break even on your investment. 
Then, after discounted cash flows of USD2,000/(USD2.83)2 in period two, then to the third power in period three and the fourth power in period four, you’ll end up with a discounted payback period metric that shows your project’s final balance. How to use payback period in your startupUsing the payback period metric in your startup is ideal when your business has liquidity constraints. The payback period metric shows how long it will take you to recover any money you spend on projects. 
Whether your projects are small or large, knowing when you’ll regain money is key. Because startups generally have financial constraints, these waiting periods matter. 
Your startup might be actively seeking capital from venture capitalists or crowdfunding. Until you receive that capital, you’re working with your own funds. Waiting too long to earn back from your investments could hurt your business and its operational flow. 
So, to plan for startup success, aim for shorter payback periods. For startups, these shorter periods typically work better than longer-term investments when considering your net present value.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/airwallex-business-growth-index,Australian Business Growth Index: Aussie SMEs continue growing globally,"BlogAustralian Business Growth Index: Aussie SMEs continue growing globally1 September 2022•4 minutesGuidesDespite rising inflation, disrupted supply chains and challenging economic conditions, Australian small businesses remain ambitious, with their sights set on international expansion. Australia is fast becoming a launchpad for successful startups and SMEs (small-to-medium-enterprises) making big waves on the global stage. However, the last few years have brought a myriad of challenges for the business community. Lockdowns, uncertainty, inflation, and supply-chain disruption have pushed Australia’s 2.4 million small businesses to evolve, innovate, and look beyond the local market for increased growth potential. That's the overwhelming message from Airwallex’s inaugural Australian Business Growth Index, which surveyed hundreds of Aussie SMEs to gain insight into their challenges, expansion plans, and what the future could look like post-pandemic.The digital economy, alongside rapid tech adoption and the rise of hybrid working, have helped to reduce the barrier for entry abroad. As a result, businesses with global operations are seeing more opportunities for growth and commercial success. Our Growth Index found a third of SMEs are already operating internationally, such as Aussie retailer Orbitkey who are making inroads across the U.S. and Asia, and Melbourne-founded Deliciou who are now open for business across multiple markets including the UK and Europe. Our research found this is set to become the new norm, with the majority of Aussie SMEs saying they plan to be operational outside of Australia in the next five years. The Growth Index found 96% of SMEs who are already operating overseas, and 99% of those planning to do so in the next twelve months, recorded growth in the last year. Looking ahead, Aussie businesses are making moves to bolster their position and weather the current economic challenges. The Australian Business Growth Index highlights how international expansion is being used as a strategy to remain resilient and viable by tapping into new markets and widening the pool of potential customers.So, what are the findings? Aussie SMEs are still growing globally  Despite sustained and varied economic challenges in the past year, 92% of Aussies SMEs told us they grew in the past 12 months.A third (34%) of Aussie SMEs say their business is currently operating outside of Australia. This is set to double in the next five years, as more than two thirds of SMEs plan to be operational outside of Australia by 2027.Southeast Asia is the top overseas destination For SMEs trading overseas, the region where they have seen the biggest growth in sales and revenue is Southeast Asia. These markets also offer the most attractive commercial opportunities for Aussie businesses.  A quarter (26%) of SMEs operating or planning to operate overseas identify Southeast Asia as the most lucrative in the year ahead. The U.S. followed closely behind Southeast Asia, with 25% of businesses with an international footprint or ambition calling the States out as the next most attractive market in the near future, surpassing China (18%) and Europe/UK (15%).Those who have made the leap abroad are reaping the rewardsFor Australian businesses already operating in international markets, the move has been lucrative. Moving overseas has unlocked access to new customer segments and broadened their overall market share. Fintech is the futureFrom startups to large-scale enterprises, businesses are now benefitting from modern and innovative technologies. A third of Aussies SMEs (35%) have already fully transitioned to digital and fintech solutions for their banking needs. These solutions not only unlock new revenue streams and business growth opportunities, but also help senior leaders achieve more efficient business operations. 
About the Airwallex Australian Business Growth IndexThe Airwallex Australian Business Growth Index is the first edition of an annual series that takes the pulse of the Australian small business ecosystem. The Index explores a range of opportunities and challenges facing the SME sector, including growth, funding, staffing and technological innovation.

Because of this, you want to ensure current customers are satisfied with your eCommerce business. 
When customers are satisfied, you retain their business — and this helps you regain the investment you made to earn them as a customer in the first place.
Retaining customers not only helps you maintain a consistent cash flow but also relieves the pressure to constantly seek new business. And one of the best ways to retain valuable, satisfied customers is by measuring customer lifetime value (CLV). 
Once you study your CLV and figure out how to improve it, watch your revenue increase over time. What is customer lifetime value (CLV)?
Let’s learn the definition of customer lifetime value. CLV (also abbreviated as CLTV) is a metric representing the total amount of profit a business can expect from one customer’s account. 
Throughout your business relationship with a certain account, you can predict the customer’s lifespan and compare that number to their revenue value. This comparison reflects CLV. 
So, the longer a customer buys from your business, the greater their CLV becomes.
When understanding customer lifetime value, think of it this way. Have you ever purchased a service or product from a business but were disappointed in either (or both)? You likely didn’t continue buying from that business because you feared being let down again. 
When customers are satisfied with your offerings — or more specifically, the offerings they purchase from you — they’ll continue to buy from your business. That’s why customer success and support teams pay attention to CLV. It helps them identify what the business should do differently to make customers happier. 
Customer support representatives can influence what happens during a customer’s journey by making recommendations or solving problems. And in turn, customer loyalty improves. 
However, CLV is also a useful metric to reference when making business decisions. You can use it to identify valuable customer segments and change your business model accordingly. 
[Related: Key performance indicators for emerging eCommerce businesses]How to calculate customer lifetime valueBefore we dive too deep, let’s learn how to calculate customer lifetime value. 
Here’s the customer lifetime value formula:
Customer lifetime value = (Customer value ✕ Average customer lifespan)
To find your CLV, you need to determine customer value. You can find this value by calculating your average purchase value and then multiplying that by your average number of purchases. You’ll likely have to look at data in your business’s computer system and run it through a software program for accuracy. 
Then, calculate your average customer lifespan. Once you have that value, multiply it by the customer value. You’ll then have your customer lifetime value calculation. 
In summary, follow these steps to find CLV:Find customer value (average purchase value ✕ average number of purchases)Find customer lifetime value (customer value ✕ average customer lifespan)The importance of customer lifetime valueCLV is important for several reasons. Here are some of the most important aspects when considering your eCommerce business’s CLV.Increase revenueThe longer a customer buys products or services from your business (also referred to as a customer life cycle), the more valuable they are to you. The length of their life cycle directly affects the revenue you earn from them. 
CLV identifies how much revenue your business earns from specific customers. So, tracking products and services that satisfy high-value customers helps you learn how to improve your CLV and thus gain more revenue.Boost loyalty and retention As we’ve noted, CLV helps businesses identify issues. These issues could be concerning trends, such as cancelled subscriptions or a high number of returned products. And when you address those problems through action items (e.g. event, task, activity), both customer retention and customer loyalty should increase. Target ideal customersOnce you know the lifetime value of a customer, you also have information on how much they’re willing to spend on your business’s products or services over time. 
Depending on the size of your business, the average customer could spend anywhere from USD20 to USD200 to USD2,000. Once you know the average range of money that customers spend, you can develop an acquisition strategy to target customers who spend the most on your offerings.Reduce customer acquisition costsTurning leads into customers can be expensive, but attracting them in the first place is also costly.
According to an article by the European Business Review, acquiring new customers is far more expensive than retaining them. This is why it’s important to identify valuable customers and nurture your relationships with them. 
Doing so will help you increase your profit margin, improve your CLV and reduce the amount you currently spend on customer acquisition.
[Related: 4 habits of highly successful eCommerce businesses]Example of customer lifetime valueTwo of the most prominent CLV types are predictive and historical CLV.Predictive CLVPredictive CLV is looking at new and existing customers’ buying behaviours with software systems, such as machine learning or regression. 
The predictive CLV model helps your business by identifying key factors:High-value customersProducts and services that bring in the most moneyImprovements to make for better customer retention Historical CLVHistorical CLV uses past data to predict the value of a customer, regardless of whether they continue buying products or services from the business in the future. 
The historical CLV model focuses on the average order value, which you then use to determine customer value. This model is mostly useful if customers interact with your eCommerce business only over a particular period rather than long term. 
However, this CLV model has disadvantages because not all customer journeys are the same. 
Any customer who the historical model determines is valuable might skew your data. This is because per the historical model, valuable customers are active customers. 
But not all customers remain active — many become inactive. The same goes for inactive customers with data you may have overlooked. They eventually could become active, which also could skew your data.Customer lifetime value in marketing and why eCommerce businesses shouldn’t overlook itDetermining CLV is an essential metric for eCommerce businesses wanting to improve customer retention and loyalty. It allows businesses to know which customers spend the most time browsing and buying products or services — and thus who’s most loyal to the brand. As long as you have a killer business plan, you can approach and improve the lifetime value of a customer through several marketing methods, and a stable yet flexible eCommerce calendar. 
Let’s go over what that entails.
[Related: The complete guide to eCommerce accounting: Selling across borders]How to improve customer lifetime value Now that you know what CLV is and how to calculate it, you might wonder how to give it a boost. Here are six strategies. Improve your onboarding processOnboarding customers is the process of getting them acquainted and involved with your brand. It involves informing them about what you do, why you do (or offer) it and why it’s beneficial for them to remain engaged with your business. 
The onboarding process happens right after a customer makes their first purchase — typically within a few days. So when a customer returns to your website to browse items or subscribe via email, they’re gradually learning about your business and deciding whether they want to continue buying from you. 
You can increase the likelihood of retaining a customer by using the data they provide to both yours and their advantage. Using their data, you can offer curated products or services with deals they may be interested in. You can also reach out to them via email to ensure the service or product they bought meets their expectations. 
As a result, you have a solid framework to support long-term customer relationships. Increase your average order valueIncreasing your average order value is another way to improve your CLV. 
When a customer makes a purchase, there are methods to increase their final payout. For instance, you can offer products related to or supporting those they’re currently buying. 
Classic upsell and cross-sell methods work extremely well to increase average purchase values, which ultimately increase your CLV. 
However, if your business is subscription-based, you can increase your average purchase value by encouraging customers to switch to a long subscription cycle, such as annual or biannual. In turn, their final payout (and your overall revenue) is higher, and your CLV simultaneously increases.Build long-term relationshipsAll relationships are built on trust — and this includes customer relationships. If customers believe your business offers the ideal products and services for their needs, they’ll continue coming back.
Customers are more likely to maintain relationships with businesses that care about fostering personal customer connections rather than focus solely on improving ROI. The goal is to form connections with people that mean more than simply earning money. 
When you care about the value of your products and services, as well as how they support customers’ lives (and perhaps their happiness), they’ll likely want to continue doing business with you. Personal connections usually last much longer than business ones. 
One way to build personal connections is by engaging with customers on social media rather than constantly sending targeted ads. You can even create meaningful dialogue with your target customer bases via to discover more about their interests. And those interests reflect the products and services they’ll truly enjoy. 
Sending free gifts is another way to help your eCommerce business stand out. When you stand out, customers remember you and are more likely to come back. When customers keep coming back, your total average revenue and profit increases —  and thus your CLV. 
[Related: How to calculate and improve ROI in easy step]Embrace customer adviceCustomers often have great insights regarding how businesses can improve. So when it comes to finding out what customers want, it makes sense to reach out to them directly. 
When you get a customer talking, it’s always better to listen than to tell. Telling customers what they should want very rarely works. Listening to their needs and what they tell you they want works. 
For instance, you can create a poll on any new products or services you have in the works and see what customers think. You don’t have to list specific options for them to choose from. Rather, you can leave blank fields for them to express their thoughts freely. 
It’s unlikely that all customers will participate. But the ones who do (usually the most loyal customers) will give you invaluable information about how to improve your offerings. Then, if a customer comes up with an idea that you end up using, give them credit and/or a gift to show your appreciation. 
Even if most of the customer advice you receive isn’t something you want to hear, taking the time to listen and thoughtfully respond matters. In the long run, your CLV and customer loyalty will increase. Empower easy connectionsWhen a customer lodges a complaint or posts a negative review, it’s vital that your employees respond promptly. You should aim for within an hour or less. This isn’t always feasible, but make a habit of striving for the shortest time possible. 
One way to shorten your response times and facilitate easy connections with customers is through social media. Hiring a team member to actively monitor and manage customers’ comments and concerns will help them feel acknowledged. 
Because CLV is based on relationships, you want to bridge the gap between you and the customer. They won’t continue buying from you if they don’t feel heard. If you can enable simple, ongoing connections with them via conversation or something else, your brand will thrive. 
[Related: How to hire for success when you’re an unknown startup]Improve customer serviceMany consumers think customer service is solely speaking with customer service representatives on the phone after an absurdly long wait time. But it’s so much more than that. 
Customer service is omnichannel support, whether by phone, website messaging, social media or email. It’s also fair, appropriate refund and return policies, as well as personalised services for existing customers. 
If you want to improve your CLV, find ways to improve customer service and the experience customers have when reaching out about anything they’re unhappy with (or perhaps especially happy with!). This shows that customers — not sales volume — are your main priority.

What lessons (if any) did you take from the experience into your career? Learn how to learn In my initial semesters at University before I became a tutor, I took a very brute force approach to learning. I’d basically rote learn all my course notes, praying that the lecturer would be lazy and the exam didn’t differ too much (unfortunately it always did). After I started tutoring, I realised that a back-to-first principles approach, which entails breaking down problems into their fundamental/core constituents, was often the best way to learn, teach and apply the content. If you only learn how to perfect the execution of individual tasks, then the ability to adapt when even something slight changes is very difficult. However if the core principles behind these tasks are understood, it's significantly easier to carry over the knowledge to a wider range of scenarios. If you can’t explain something simply, you don’t understand it well enoughI stole this saying from the great Albert Einstein. This quote also ties into the previous point around ‘learning how to learn’ — it really hit home for me after I started teaching. When I started tutoring, I struggled to be articulate in my presentation to students and tended to overcomplicate topics. I realised that I was trying to simply teach the course material rather than the concepts that underpin them. This lesson also applies in the workplace. Communicating complex ideas in a simple way that focuses on the ‘Why’ is a method I've found to be particularly effective in bringing everyone along on the journey. If you aren’t able to get buy-in from your peers and the wider business, your idea/solution will never get off the ground.We hear you collect sayings and change them frequently – what are your current favourite expressions?  ‘Is the juice worth the squeeze?’: Just because we can build something, doesn’t mean we should.

Finally for culture, it's India. Pre-pandemic, I frequently travelled to India to see a large portion of my extended family (I have 36 first cousins!). Visiting India provides an opportunity to spend time with them and get in touch with my roots (and as a result, I wind up eating non-stop and gaining a lot of weight after!).Is getting into a race car your favourite way to unwind? Really?From a very young age, I've always had a fascination for anything that moves fast (maybe that’s why I enjoy working at Airwallex!). My biggest interest lies in Motorsport as it has always been a childhood dream of mine to be a racing driver. Motorsport can be quite prohibitive to get into. Other than occasional social go-karting, this remained just a dream for a long time. My breakthrough came late last year, when I saw an opening in a Formula Vee race team (a popular, entry level category) in Victoria called ‘Akurra Motorsport’ and decided to give it a go. I did a test with them and managed to secure a seat to compete in the 2022 Victorian State Series Championship.Racing requires a high level of concentration, so when I’m driving, my mind is completely clear.

But they’re especially important for startups because the early stages of your business require a substantial amount of planning. 
Here, we’ll explore all the steps involved in carrying out effective board meetings, whether that’s preparing, running or closing them.Why is it important to prepare for board meetings?It’s important that you organise, strategise and collect all the materials you need for your board meeting before it starts. Nothing is more stressful than scrambling for documents before an important meeting.
If you don’t have your required documents on hand before a meeting, you’ll likely be left fumbling for words and data.
But this goes further than simply having your folders stacked neatly before the meeting starts. It’s smart to send board members those documents at least one week in advance. If you present everything to them on the spot, they’ll have difficulty thinking clearly about the matter and asking pertinent questions. 
All these factors are important, so you should take them all into consideration when preparing for a board meeting. The better your pre-meeting preparation is, the more proactive, productive and successful the actual meeting will be. Roles within a board meetingHere are some common roles in a board meeting.ChairThe chair is a board director who leads the board and oversees and runs the meetings (e.g. sets the agenda). If there’s an executive committee, the chair leads it as well. They’re also the primary contact with the chief executive officer. 
A chairperson communicates performance objectives with the CEO and delivers their review. And if a CEO leaves their position, the chairperson leads the selection process to narrow down a top candidate. 
Depending on the business’s size, the chairperson is one of the few authorised board spokespersons. Overall, the chair is responsible for setting the demeanour and effectiveness of the entire board.Vice chairThe vice chair serves on the executive committee (if there is one) and is responsible for stepping in and taking over the chair’s responsibilities when needed. This could be because the chair is leaving their role or absent for whatever reason.
The chair and vice chair have a supportive and close working relationship to ensure board meetings are prepped and effective. TreasurerThe treasurer has a strong financial management background and is in regular contact with the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO). They retain this contact to ensure the board has important financial documents well before a meeting. 
A treasurer marks questions or looks for areas that need clarification before meetings. And if there’s a financial or audit committee, the treasurer serves on it as the committee chair.
A treasurer’s primary, specialised task is to identify potential financial risks including investments.Board secretaryIf there’s an executive committee, the board secretary (or corporate secretary, depending on the business’s size) serves on it. But their primary responsibility is ensuring the board’s records are secure and accurate. 
The board secretary also takes meeting minutes and reviews those minutes after the meeting if needed. How to prepare for a board meetingProperly preparing for a board meeting takes several weeks to months. This is because you need to cover multiple tasks and address crucial details. To help you better prepare for your meeting, we’ve created a checklist you can follow.Review notes from previous board meetingsA corporate secretary (and sometimes other staff) usually takes notes on all the matters covered during a board meeting. Once the meeting adjourns, the corporate secretary and their team debrief the notes and schedule to-do tasks. 
The corporate secretary typically uses these scheduled items in the first draft of the next meeting’s agenda. However, the executive team might also hold a debriefing session on a day soon after the meeting. The team sends any notes taken during that meeting to the secretary to include as agenda items for the next meeting. 
Once your first draft is complete, it’s time to start planning for the next meeting — even if it’s months down the road. Review the board’s calendarMany board members have varying schedules, may or may not work in-office and are likely scattered across different time zones. 
It’s vital that every member attends the board meeting, which is why you need to look at the board’s annual calendar to select the best month, day and time for everyone. 
Depending on how many board meetings your business typically holds, you should appropriately space out meetings so that there’s adequate time for debriefing and completing action items. 
The general counsel's office or the corporate secretary usually looks at the board’s annual calendar six to eight weeks before a meeting. And because the annual calendar contains agenda and action items with set times, it’s the foundation for the next meeting’s agenda and date.
Sometimes businesses have routine meetings exclusive to management where the CEO contributes their own supplemental agenda items. But those meetings also provide the opportunity for the CFO, chief human resources officer and other management members to raise additional questions and pitch agenda or action items. 
It’s also helpful when there are enough management meetings before the board meeting so that board members can read and analyse documents in advance. Approve the final meeting agenda Once you establish the agenda, it requires review and approval. You must share the agenda with the lead director or board chair to gain that review and approval. 
They then add agenda items, action items and comments, and they may delete parts that are no longer relevant.Review board materials The general counsel or corporate secretary (or someone else close to the board team) reads through the meeting’s agenda and required materials. 
Typos, inconsistencies and missing materials are bad for board meetings. They make your team look unprofessional and underprepared, so holding an attentive, focused review is vital. 
Some businesses’ boards even have preset guidelines — similar to a content style guide — that outline preferred formats, lengths and fonts standard to board reports. Prepare documents for agenda itemsPreparing documents refers to gathering the materials needed to discuss agenda items during the board meeting. Reference sections are important, too. They aren’t always part of meeting dialogue, but if an agenda item needs further context, the reference section provides it. 
Reference sections might include data analysis text, credible statistics, investor relations reports, topic scans and much more. 
However, because hybrid and remote work environments are now common, resource sections are increasingly popular. Having a reference section is much more convenient than wading through a giant binder packed with board meeting documents. 
These digital board meeting solutions contain all the documents that a traditional board meeting binder would. Here are some items that might be available for reference:Environmental scansInvestor relations reports (unless it’s a main agenda item)Governance topic summariesExecutive management input HR initiatives Divisional reports Insider trading reminders Send board materials in advanceWhile every member of a business is important, board members clearly have many responsibilities that put a great deal of pressure on their shoulders. They may be part of other boards, so they have a lot to keep track of — especially with a crowded schedule. 
So, to help them thoroughly (and easily) prepare, it’s wise to send them all meeting-relevant materials at least one week in advance. That way, they have sufficient time to review documents, and the information is fresh in their minds before the meeting. 
Sending documents only a couple of days in advance doesn’t leave board members enough time to review and absorb the information. 
However, sending materials at least one week in advance gives them enough time to digest the information and make any needed changes. A board portal (another digital solution) is helpful for last-minute additions or deletions because the changes occur instantly. Set a strict time for meeting adjournmentMeetings don’t have to drag on. Once everyone’s covered all agenda items, the meeting can end. 
And even if lingering questions gradually arise, it’s unnecessary to wait for them to resonate with attendees in a stuffy conference room. Board members can resolve most leftover meeting questions and answers via email or other internal communication channels, such as Slack. 
Additionally, it’s best to reschedule or cancel the meeting under some circumstances:When there’s not enough time to prepareWhen there are sensitive topics better addressed in privateWhen you can accomplish the same goal with a different communication method, like a general meeting with select board membersSetting a board meeting agendaYour agenda structure is the outline that every attendee will (or should) closely follow during the board meeting. Let’s go over how to structure your board meeting agenda so that you don’t miss any key items or decisions needing review. 
Here’s how to structure your board meeting agenda.Heading Your board meeting agenda heading should list your business’s name and address. It should also include the meeting’s date, time and location.Call to orderAt the start of the meeting, the board chair announces a call to order and the current time. A corporate secretary then writes the call to order time in the minutes. 
Then, the board chair gives welcoming remarks to introduce attendees. They may introduce participants personally, ask for participants to introduce themselves or read the business’s mission and/or vision statements. Ask for agenda changesOnce the introduction is complete, the board chair asks whether anyone needs to make  last-minute changes to the agenda. 
If changes need to be made, the corporate secretary must amend the agenda to include new items or delete items. However, if no one requests changes, the board can approve the previous meeting minutes. Minutes approval “Approval of Minutes” is aligned with the most recent board meeting. 
Board members should have copies of the minutes before the current meeting starts. This gives attendees the opportunity to ask questions or request agenda corrections. 
If the corporate secretary didn’t receive any last-minute change requests before the meeting, they make the necessary agenda changes. Then, the board chair approves the minutes. ReportsNow, attendees review reports. The executive director evaluates a report and provides an assessment, usually for projects and project initiatives. This is also when the board addresses a business outlook overview concerning current trends, any new initiatives on the horizon or something else altogether. 
Once the executive director has assessed projects and initiatives, the head of finance presents a report. These timely financial reports outline the business’s profitability and performance over one or more past quarters, as well as a projection of its expected future performance. Discuss old businessIt may not be fun, but discussing past business is necessary. By doing so, businesses can determine what they did (or didn’t) do well and craft better solutions for the future. 
However, old business can still be relevant to current or ongoing business activities, such as conferences and events.
Board meetings are great opportunities to discuss plans of execution before event dates. Discuss new business Of course, you must discuss new business as well.
Board meetings are ideal for planning proposals or general topics beforehand. This relates to adding new action items to the agenda and noting how to move the business forward. Adjourn the meetingOnce board members have addressed all agenda items and no one has further questions, the meeting can end. The chair is responsible for adjourning the meeting.
And because businesses have different priorities depending on their size and area of expertise, you can customise this approach as you see fit. Questions to ask at a board meeting
In terms of your growth strategy and business’s mission and values, your executive team should be prepared to answer questions such as these: What is our business’s long-term vision?What is our business’s growth plan?What are the largest hurdles for our business? Money matters, too. Here are some financial questions to ask about your startup’s financial state and future projections:Do our financial and strategic plans match?What are the assets stated on our current balance sheet?What are our cash flow objectives, and how do they compare to past objectives?Your company’s culture should be healthy. Here some questions to reflect upon — they’ll help you overcome obstacles and provide executive insight on employee satisfaction:How is our executive team currently functioning?How are we currently empowering and supporting employees?What is our plan for gaining and retaining top talent?Lastly, you should think about risk management. Here are some risk management-related questions to ask that ensure you quickly address and mitigate both internal and external risks: What are our business’s top risks? How are we currently managing our risks?How often are our risks likely to occur?Take your startup further with Airwallex Airwallex helps startups push into new global markets whilst improving their profit margins.Open 11 foreign currency accounts at the click of a button and collect, hold and send funds across borders with zero transaction fees.

This consideration makes perfect sense. Because SaaS businesses are subscription-based, a business can have a solid product, great management team and steady history of growth, but if the business’s net revenue retention (NRR) is average or below average, obtaining funding could be challenging. Why? Investors consider NRR a key performance indicator (KPI) for a SaaS start-up. Any start-up looking for investment should understand the importance of analysing and optimising NRR internally before a funding round. The start-up should do so especially if its KPI metric is average or below average.To understand all this information broadly and specifically, we’ll go over what NRR is, why it’s important and how a related KPI (e.g. gross revenue retention, or GRR) allows investors to determine whether a business is retaining its existing customers. [Related: 10 key business metrics every start-up founder needs to know] What is NRR?NRR is the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers over a month or a year. NRR also includes revenue from customer upgrades, cross-sales, downgrades and cancellations.According to industry data, the valuation of a SaaS business with high revenue retention can be double that of a business with average rates. In this space, potential investors will focus their analyses on the business’s customer base and growth potential.NRR and GRR do not directly indicate to management or an investor that the business is losing customers. These KPIs tell investors how well the business is generating and retaining revenue from customers over a certain period — again, usually a month or a year.Overall, NRR helps businesses determine their “churn” rate. A churn rate is the percentage of current customers cancelling subscriptions. A deep understanding of a business’s NRR and churn rate will guide management towards ways of optimising their NRR to attract investors.[Related: How to calculate burn rate (the right way!)]Why is NRR important?NRR helps a SaaS venture understand how its churn rate influences its overall revenue and whether it might be losing low-value or high-value customers. Think of NRR as a proxy for customer satisfaction and success. It’s a primary consideration for an investor.A business that retains NRR signifies that its sales and customer teams are gaining repeat sales or even expanding sales to existing customers. Enthusiastic customers are more likely to praise the business’s virtues and product(s) to other potential customers. Or in other words, they’ll say good things about the business, which will likely lead to more sales and thus more growth. Understanding NRR is critical because the average cost to acquire new customers in the SaaS industry is only USD205. In essence, compared to other industries, the SaaS sales environment is highly competitive.An NRR over 100% indicates a business is retaining existing customers and growing sales quite well. Moreover, an NRR at 100% means the business can continue to grow even if it doesn’t gain another customer.How to calculate NRRTo calculate NRR, you need four specific data points:Last month’s recurring revenueChurn rate (percentage of current customers cancelling their subscriptions)Revenue ‘expansion’, meaning revenue from upgrades, cross-sales and increased pricesRevenue from any downgrades or cancellationsOnce you know this information, the formula to calculate NRR looks like this: NRR = [(total revenue + expansion revenue) – churn] / total revenueExample of an NRR calculationAssume the SaaS business has 100 customers paying USD2,000 per year to subscribe to its software. During the relevant period, 10 customers cancel, 80 renew their subscriptions and 10 upgrade to a USD4000 per year subscription package.With this information, the business’s NRR is as follows:[(USD200,000 + USD40,000) – USD20,000] / USD200,000 = 110%In this example, the business and potential investors can see that although the business has lost some customers over the period, the average revenue that each remaining customer has generated has increased.So, from an investor’s perspective, this business’s NRR suggests a stable customer base as well as future revenue growth.GRR and NRR: What’s the difference?GRR also measures revenue lost from the customer base, but the calculation doesn’t include expansion income from cross-sales, upgrades and price increases. In this way, GRR provides a clearer picture of existing customer retention because increasing expansion income can’t obscure customer cancellations. That’s why many investors prefer to analyse GRR rather than NRR.GRR will always be equal to or lower than NRR, and GRR will never be greater than 100%.GRR = (total revenue – churn) / total revenueIn the example above, GRR would equal 90%. GRR shows investors that while the business may be doing a great job at upselling some existing customers, if it’s losing customers on an absolute basis, growth could eventually stall or decrease. That’s if a critical large customer cancels their subscription.In other words, NRR may be above 100%, but if GRR is low, potential investors will be very cautious and will likely ask for further analytics or decline an investment opportunity altogether.[Related: How to calculate opportunity cost]The 3 things venture capitalists look for in NRR and GRRAn NRR at or above 100% suggests a business is excelling at upselling and servicing remaining customers (despite any customer losses). It’s unsurprising that potential investors in a SaaS business want to see an NRR at or above 100%.High GRR indicates a sustainable revenue stream and future growth. Generally, in the SaaS investing ecosystem, many venture capitalists look for a GRR between 75% and 90%. Some venture capitalists prefer NRR to provide an insight into product acceptance and customer satisfaction because it focuses on revenue generation from all sources — including upgrading happy customers.To a potential investor, a high NRR and a lower GRR might simply mean the business is focusing its sales and marketing efforts on high-value customers and shedding low-value ones.Lastly, potential investors in a SaaS business want to see a low churn rate. NRR and GRR help that analysis. A low churn rate means the business is excelling at retaining customers in an absolute sense but doesn’t account for revenue expansion.In short, a business with a high NRR and a high GRR will likely attract venture capitalists’ interest. And a business with a high NRR and low GRR might raise questions concerning growth sustainability.A business with a low NRR has work to do if it seeks investment.How to optimise your NRRA high churn rate or low NRR could indicate deficiencies in customer or technical support and technical issues. Or it could mean that sales teams are trying to upgrade new customers too aggressively (or too quickly), and these customers are leaving at the first opportunity. In any case, what can a SaaS business do to increase NRR?Customer segmentation is a valuable analytic exercise. Separating high-value and low-value customers will inform strategies to increase expansion revenue in high-value customers. For high-value customers, a high-touch model with substantial personal coaching and training might be the answer. The business might interact with low-value customers with more of a tech-touch model.Another way to increase NRR is to closely monitor customer behavioural data and other adoption trends. Quantitative and qualitative data on service utilisation, product usage, engagement and customer support and satisfaction should provide a ‘customer health’ score. For example, analysing such data might provide insight on the right time to try to cross-sell or upgrade because of a high customer health metric.Relentlessly focusing on customer success can also benefit NRR. Customer success directly correlates to the value a customer realises in doing business with your business. If the business doesn’t have a dedicated customer success team, then you should create one.If your business has a client success team but is losing customers at an unacceptable rate, the business could attempt to link all or part of the success team’s compensation to customer renewals and expansion revenue.The goal of any effort to increase NRR is to increase customer success.[Related: The pain-free guide to managing business expenses]The financial suite for fast-growing start-upsAirwallex helps fast-growing businesses push into new markets without losing money in excess fees. Open 11 foreign currency accounts at the click of a button and collect, hold and send funds across borders with zero transaction fees.With an Airwallex account, you can manage all your funds in one place, and better monitor your business’s financial position.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/funding-rounds,From seed to Series E: Understanding funding rounds,"BlogFrom seed to Series E: Understanding funding rounds8 August 2022•5-minutesBusiness tipsStart-upsIn this article•How does funding work? •Finding your potential investors•How business valuation works•Start-up funding stages•What investors look for•Streamline your finances with AirwallexCapital is the lifeline of any business from start-ups to established, successful enterprises. But how do they gain access to capital? Start-ups and pre-initial public offering (IPO) businesses generally raise money through a series of funding rounds. And the amount of money raised and its source is variable. Some businesses need initial and developmental seed capital while others need expansion financing. Or, some might require large, late-stage hedge fund, bank and private office investments. So, for potential investors and founders looking to understand the entire process better, we’ve put together this guide. It lays out terms used during funding rounds as well as explaining how it all works.How does funding work? Finding money to start a business, develop and validate your product or service, generate revenue and fund growth varies at different business stages. And depending on the funding round, the type of investor will vary, too. Founders, family, friends or wealthy people often provide the initial capital to start a business and fund its concept and development. But large institutional investors will typically add needed capital later in the business’s life. This is often just before an IPO. That additional capital helps to expand new market growth, finance acquisitions and support the business’s overall value. In exchange for this funding, investors may receive an ownership stake (i.e. equity) in the venture. The amount of equity a potential investor might want for its investment usually varies at different funding stages. However, if your capital investment is coming from family and friends, it’s unlikely that they’ll expect an ownership stake in exchange for early investment in a start-up. Venture capital firms and institutional investors will certainly expect an ownership stake. And it’s comparable to the funding round, the business’s metrics and the investment amount. As you might expect, the funding amounts in start-ups and early stage businesses are much smaller than the investments in rapidly growing later-stage businesses on the verge of an IPO. However, the valuation of a start-up also changes because investors perform a new valuation at each funding round. Or in other words, their expectations change throughout the stages of a funding cycle. Risk and returnFounders and friends often firmly believe an idea or business will succeed. They enthusiastically embrace the risk and reward ratio that comes with starting a business and investing seed capital. If anything, it’s exciting!However, venture capital firms and institutional investors have different views of risk and return. They generally demand rigorous data and metrics to validate a business’s success and justify a potential investment.So, you can expect any venture that evolves from an idea to a successful, publicly traded corporation to participate in several funding rounds. Most successful start-ups go through at least three funding rounds. Though a start-up with groundbreaking technology or veteran management with a successful track record might leapfrog the typical funding progression.These are the terms people generally use during the start-up funding cycle: Pre-seedSeed Series A Series B Series CSeries DSeries ESome businesses might require an additional round or two after Series C to achieve certain milestones before an IPO. Those additional funding rounds are known as Series D and Series E financing. We’ll dig into each funding series and what it involves a bit later.[Related: Choosing your North Star Metric]Finding your potential investorsHow does an entrepreneur find people or businesses willing to invest in a start-up? How does a start-up attract investors for much larger capital amounts later in the business’s life cycle? Who invests at each stage?Investors at a start-up’s earliest, pre-seed stage are usually very different from potential investors at a seed or Series A funding. Seed or Series A investors may differ from Series B or C investors. Founders, friends, family members or single angel investors usually fund start-ups in the pre-seed stage. Some start-ups attempt to raise initial capital through crowdsourcing platforms.At the seed or Series A funding stage, sophisticated angel investors or venture capital firms typically provide equity funding to promising start-ups. Other venture capital firms, hedge funds, private equity firms and investment banks might invest at the Series B or C stage. Many venture capital firms will invest in any business with substantial potential. However, other firms focus on particular industry niches or technologies.The bottomline is that knowing the investors in your space will help you find potential funding sources.Industry knowledge, research and networking are critical to finding investors at any stage of funding. And leveraging professional contacts both in and out of your industry will lead to finding potential investors. And for the founders and management team, investing time into developing relationships with targeted potential investors could very well lead to funding. No sophisticated investor writes a cheque at the first meeting. And the deeper the relationship, the fewer meetings and presentations a start-up will likely need to close a particular funding round.However, for an early start-up, joining an incubator or accelerator can put founders in touch with potential investors already interested in working with promising young businesses. Incubators often mentor start-ups, and those relationships lead to opportunities to pitch potential investors for seed or Series A funding.What’s more, finding opportunities to present the start-up’s business and product(s) at a demo day or an investor day is another way to land investors.[Related: How to calculate opportunity cost]How business valuation worksValuation is the quantitative process of determining a business’s current or projected fair worth. So before any funding round, analysts working for the business, potential investors, or both, will determine a business’s valuation. There are two main categories of valuation methods: Absolute valuation models. This considers intrinsic business fundamentals such as revenue, profit, cash flow, dividends and growth to arrive at a valuation.Relative valuation models. This compares the business’s metrics to those of similar businesses to reach a valuation. These often don’t work well in valuing start-ups because start-ups have no financial history or might even be exploring or pioneering a field.Indeed, pre-seed start-ups typically assign a hypothetical business valuation. But how do start-ups determine value in this case? At this stage, valuation is really what a start-up convinces an investor it’s worth.At the seed or Series A stage, more data exists for valuation. The start-up has proof of concept and projected market potential. And it might have even made some sales or strategic relationships.  In any event, start-ups can derive valuations at any stage from multiple factors. These include:Earlier valuationsManagementTrack recordMarket sizeRiskProprietary technology or other barriers to entryExisting revenue and customersGrowth prospectsMilestone achievements As a guide, seed stage valuations tend to range from USD2 million to USD10 million.[Related: The pain-free guide to managing business expenses]Start-up funding stagesLet’s explore the stages of start-up funding.Pre-seed fundingThe earliest stage of start-up funding is called ‘pre-seed’. As the term implies, the business is just getting started. A business’s founders, friends and family members usually provide pre-seed funding. But as we learned before, they often don’t make investments in exchange for equity at this stage because the founders provide the money. So depending on the nature of the business and initial start-up costs, the duration of this funding stage can vary. Pre-seed funding amounts can range from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Seed fundingSeed funding is the first official equity funding stage. Seed funding provides financing to complete your product or develop a concept, conduct market research and hire important personnel onto your team. Start-ups often use seed funding to build a founding management team to complete the projects stated above. Ideally, the amount raised at this stage will make the start-up profitable. But a more realistic funding goal should be to raise as much money to get to the next ‘fundable’ milestone. This is typically 12 to 18 months down the road.Potential investors at the seed funding stage include founders (again), angel investors, incubators and venture capital firms. At this stage, investors want equity in exchange for their investment.The seed funding environment is more dynamic and complex than in the pre-seed environment. Many new venture capital firms, sometimes called ‘super angels’ or ‘micro-venture capitalists’, target very early stage businesses for investment. And similar to pre-seed funding, the amount of money raised during the seed stage varies widely. It will generally range from a few hundred thousand dollars to USD2 million. However, the amount of seed funding has increased in recent years due to flush venture capital firms and increased investor interest.  Series A fundingThe Series A funding stage follows the seed stage. At this stage, the start-up has proof of its concept and should have a sound business model predicting long-term profits. Investors in the Series A funding stage are usually traditional venture capital firms, although equity crowdfunding recently has been filling a funding gap at this stage. Many start-ups that obtain seed funding fail to get Series A funding. Only about one in every three startups will go on to Series A and so forth. So, in a Series A raise, it’s not uncommon for a single venture capital firm to be an ‘anchor’ investor. The thinking goes that once a start-up has secured its first major investor in Series A, other investors will follow.Business valuation in Series A funding can range in the tens of millions of dollars. Though some ‘unicorns’ might be valued at a much higher level in Series A because of pioneering technology, a rapidly developing customer base, a ‘rock star’ founding team or a combination of the three.Consider 2021 — the average Series A funding was USD10 million. Businesses typically seek to raise anywhere between USD2 million to USD15 million in Series A funding. Series B fundingBusinesses seeking Series B funding have products and are generating revenue. They’ve achieved enough milestones that their valuations reflect their work. And now they want to elevate their businesses past the initial development stage into the growth stage. Series B businesses have developed large user or customer bases and have proved to investors that the venture can succeed on a large scale. You can expect businesses with Series B money to hire more talent and fill out product development, quality, sales, advertising and customer support teams.In 2019, the average Series B business valuation was USD58 million. And the average Series B investment was $32 million per business. Series B investors could involve many of the same participants as those in Series A, including key anchor investors. But Series B funding often brings other venture investors that specialise in later-stage financing, specifically when a start-up’s prospects are clearer. However, there is still risk to investors at this stage because a start-up that has exceeded in a smaller market might not succeed in a larger market or a new market.Series C funding and beyondA Series C business is already successful — it should have brand or name recognition, an established customer base, strong revenue streams and healthy growth prospects. However, the business might need another funding round in preparation for an IPO or an acquisition. It also might want to expand into new markets or develop new products. Although Series C is usually a start-up’s last funding stage, some businesses seek additional funding rounds in a push to complete unfinished goals from Series C funding or to boost valuation before an IPO.So, because a Series C business has proven its success, it will have a higher valuation. In 2019, the average Series C investment was USD55 million. The average valuation for Series C businesses is USD115 million.In addition to the Series B funding stage investors, Series C investors could include hedge funds, investment banks, private equity firms, other institutional investors and private family offices. These late-stage investors typically invest large sums of money in a Series C financing round, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And they often expect to at least double their investment.What investors look forInvestors in start-ups have different expectations at different funding stages. At the seed stage, potential investors consider the viability of business or product concept, technological innovation and the people behind a new venture. Seed investors might demand large equity stakes at this stage, given the risk inherent in a new venture or the lack of other financing available to the founders.Series A investors want more than a great idea. They expect proof of concept and a rigorous strategic plan to monetise that great idea. Furthermore, they may consider factors such as any past sales, risk, current growth rate and target market size. Series B and Series C investors expect a well-established business with a strong customer base and scalability. In the Series B pitch, investors expect to review management’s detailed plans for using the Series B funds to boost product development and customer teams, expand sales reach, and invest in people and infrastructure needed to satisfy the demands of rapid growth. Series C investors also expect a successful business with proven metrics. And they’ll typically invest large sums before an IPO or other liquidation event.   [Related: How to calculate ROI: It’s not as hard as you think]Streamline your finances with AirwallexIf your start-up is ready to push into new markets and streamline its finances, contact Airwallex. We offer Global Business Accounts in 11 currencies that will free you to grow your business across borders without the associated costs. Collect, convert and spend money in multiple currencies without high fees, and manage all your funds from a single account.

But it may not always be right for your type of business. Crowdfunding is also a viable option. Whether you’re scaling up to access more resources or you want a buffer for future growth endeavours, there are several reasons your start-up may need to secure more funding. Here, we’ll take a look at the two most common methods of raising financing: VC and equity crowdfunding (ECF). VC is a traditional source of funding that provides you with large sums of capital from a few sources. But ECF has grown in popularity and provides modest amounts of funding more often than you’d receive through VC. Depending on your start-up and its financial needs, one may work better than the other. Let’s dig into why. What is venture capital, and what is its background? First, let’s discuss the history of VC.A little backgroundVC is a subset of private equity (PE). The roots of PE go back to World War II. Georges Goriot, a Harvard Business School professor, is considered the father of venture capital. He founded the American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) in 1946 and raised over USD3.5 million in funding to invest in companies that created commercially saleable technology during the war. Goriot’s first investment was USD200,000, which he put towards an X-ray technology company that treated cancer. Once the X-ray business went public in 1955, his original investment ended up growing over USD1.8 million. What is venture capital?VC is a subset of PE. It’s a type of financing that investors provide to start-ups and small-to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that have the potential for long-term growth. Providing VC to businesses considering expansion is also relatively common. VC typically comes from investment banks and other financial institutions that scout small, young businesses (i.e. start-ups) with potential that need financial help. VC funding doesn’t always take a monetary form. Your start-up can also receive ‘help’ in a technical or managerial sense. But the bottom line is that providing VC is typically set aside for start-ups and small companies that have highly recognisable growth potential. Investors also provide VC to companies on the verge of expanding. Such companies will likely start bringing in a substantial amount of capital that will eventually pay back investors.Although it’s always a risk for investors to fund small businesses (or unknown start-ups), it supports their next endeavour — whether that’s growth or expansion. And those endeavours will likely lead to better profitability. So, businesses without access to bank loans, capital markets or other monetary sources to fund their operations will typically seek out means through investors. The main downside to VC is that investors usually get equity. In other words, they own a portion of your company and therefore have a say in the business decisions you make. We’ll explore that a little more later. How do venture capitalists work?VC firms establish independent limited partnerships with businesses. In an average deal, businesses seeking funding will distribute or ‘sell’ large portions of the business to a few investors through independent limited partnerships. Sometimes these partnerships include similar enterprises. In this case, a venture capitalist or VC firm might invest in a particular idea that these small businesses pursue. However, the greatest difference between VC and other private equity deals is that VC focuses on new businesses that need first-time funding. PE typically focuses on more established, larger companies. PE deals might seek an equity infusion or even a chance for a start-up’s founders to transfer their ownership. What is the venture capital process?The first step for any business seeking VC is to create a business plan and submit it to a VC firm or an angel investor. However, the difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is that an angel investor is generally an affluent person who invests their own money.A venture capitalist is usually employed at a firm that invests with risk capital. This means it invests other people’s money rather than its own. If the investor is interested in the proposal, then they’ll typically thoroughly research the company. This means investigating the start-up’s business model, products and services, management, operating history and more to determine whether it’s worth investing a great deal of money into. Many investors, both venture capitalists who work at firms and angel investors who work independently, have background experience as equity research analysts. They do so most often through a particular industry, such as healthcare. So their research into your start-up doesn’t involve deciding whether they think your business has a ‘good idea’. They look into whether your company will realistically see growth, profitability and expansion. In other words, if you do well, then the investor does well. So, they look for start-ups with a high potential of performing well in a particular industry. Once diligent research is complete, the firm or investor proposes a pledge. This pledge is a certain amount of capital they’re willing to invest in exchange for a portion of your company (i.e. equity). They provide the funds either as one large, individual sum or in rounds. Distributing capital through funding rounds is most common. Once the investor or firm begins distributing funding, they take an active role in advising the company. By advising and monitoring the progress of the start-up, firms can steer their ‘investment’ in the right direction for a better chance at growth. The firm might also want to see progress and success markers before releasing any additional funds. Once the start-up has performed well over a period, the investor or firm then exits the company. They’ll initiate a merger, acquisition or initial public offering (IPO). Pros and cons of venture capitalLet’s look at the pros and cons of VC to determine whether it’s a suitable route for your business. Venture capital prosYour start-up will access a large sum of capital in a short period. VC firms have substantial experience investing in start-ups, so your business has a better chance of growing. Your start-up gains prestige and credibility if a notable firm decides to invest in it. Venture capital consA very small amount of start-ups receive VC, so if you do, you’re part of an exclusive club — but it’s certainly difficult to get there. Your investor or investor firm will pressure your start-up to perform well. This might be the push your start-up needs to see growth, but it puts stress on your business model, founders and employees. You lose control over your business. You won’t lose all control, but venture capitalists seek out terms that are most advantageous to them, often at the founders’ expense. They often force out company founders if the terms aren’t ideal for a long enough time.[Related: Net working capital: How to calculate it and why it’s important]What is equity crowdfunding?ECF involves receiving numerous small amounts of money from many people to fund your start-up. How many people you can access depends on the extent of your network. If your network is big, you can easily access many people. But even if your network is on the smaller side, many crowdfunding websites and social media platforms bridge the gap between entrepreneurs and investors. So through crowdfunding, smaller-scale start-ups can expand their pool of investors beyond relatives, founders, owners and venture capitalists. How does crowdfunding work?Most jurisdictions have restrictions on who can fund start-ups, as well as how much they’re allowed to contribute. These restrictions are similar to those of hedge fund investing. Putting regulations in place protects non-wealthy and generally naive investors from putting too much of their money into a start-up that may or may not do well. If an unsophisticated investor puts all their life savings into a start-up that ends up failing, it’s detrimental to that person’s future and financial stability. Many businesses fail, so it’s reasonable to have restrictions in place. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s difficult to raise money from crowdfunding. It’s still a viable way for entrepreneurs to find the capital they need to grow. Your start-up has the potential to raise hundreds to millions of dollars. Crowdfunding is a great opportunity, as long as you have a great business idea and a convincing pitch for waiting investors. However, crowdfunding sites receive a portion of the funds you raise. [Related: How to calculate opportunity cost]Types of crowdfundingThere are two traditional types of crowdfunding. Start-ups seeking help via capital funding to bring their product or service to life is one type. People who are dealing with some sort of emergency, such as a natural disaster, medical expense or tragedy (e.g. house fire), do the other. However, creatives — including writers, artists, musicians and podcasters — also use crowdfunding platforms to help sustain their professional and personal lives. These creative lines of work often don't have steady or stable sources of income. So, crowdfunding is a feasible solution for those needing or offering financial help.Pros and cons of equity crowdfunding (ECF)Let’s look at some of the pros and cons of ECF. Pros of crowdfundingStart-ups will typically offer common shares (i.e. non-voting) that allow founders to maintain control over their business rather than let investors dictate how founders carry out operations.Crowdfunding also helps start-ups gain hundreds to thousands of investors who likely later become customers. Many of them also become champions of the brand, which in turn, increases word of mouth. Crowdfunding also allows start-ups to constantly raise money rather than receive it as one large individual sum or in small gradual sums from investors. Cons of crowdfundingStart-ups don’t have any certainty regarding whether they’ll meet their funding goal. When working with a VC firm, they’ll provide the amount of money that you propose you need. However, crowdfunding might not fully add up to what you need. All money given to start-ups through crowdfunding is public, so your financial reporting will be very transparent. It should always be transparent, but crowdfunding guarantees everyone involved knows when, from whom and how much you receive. Your crowdfunding campaign typically has marketing costs through the platform you use. You’ll likely also have to pay legal and accounting costs.Examples of crowdfundingHere are some popular examples of crowdfunding sites:Kickstarter: A platform that helps in bringing creative projects to life including film, music, theatre, art, photography, design and more. GoFundMe: An American for-profit platform that helps raise money for life events including funerals, illnesses, accidents, graduations, schooling and more.IndieGoGo: A platform that helps in raising funds for innovative ideas, charities and start-up businesses.Patreon: A membership platform providing content creators with business tools to run a subscription service to earn a monthly income. In return, subscribers earn perks.Substack: A platform providing payment, analytics, publishing and design help to support e-newsletters received by subscribers. Writers can send e-newsletters directly to subscribers. Oculus VR, for example, raised crowdfunded capital on Kickstarter in 2012. The start-up specialises in virtual reality (VR) software and hardware products, such as VR headsets for gamers. The founders’ original goal was to raise USD250,000, but they managed to secure USD2.4 million. Four years later in 2014, Facebook (now Meta) acquired Oculus for USD2.3 billion in both stock and cash. Another successful Kickstarter campaign was for M3D, which manufactures micro-3D printers. The founders were able to raise USD3.4 million for their product in 2017. And now, you can find their printers anywhere — from Amazon to Staples to Brookstonne and more. No other Kickstarter campaign has raised an amount that high over a 30- or 60-day period.Venture capital vs crowdfundingNow that you know the differences between VC and ECF, let’s directly compare the two by examining their key distinctions.Your control over your start-upRaising capital through ECF is better for entrepreneurs because doing so gives them more control. Giving up board sets isn’t ideal, which is what often happens when raising VC. So, if you choose to raise a large individual or a few sums of capital via VC, be ready to accept any terms that your investor proposes concerning your business model and operations. If you choose to raise money via crowdfunding, expect to receive small amounts of capital spanning many investors and to maintain full control over your business. Your investment networkThe value of your start-up (i.e. the product and service you sell) will increase alongside the higher number of buyers, sellers or users you have. This is the ‘network effect’. With ECF, any person who participates in your crowdfund will essentially increase in value because the network effect creates a positive feedback loop. Your returns will likely increase the bigger your network is. The network effect isn’t achievable through VC because there isn’t a network attracting another network. Your business model criteriaVC firms have particular criteria they use to determine what and whom they want to invest in. These criteria are generally much stricter than on crowdfunding sites. Crowdfunding sites allow you to raise small amounts of capital from several sources, but a venture capitalist or their firm will be highly involved in your business, both time- and money-wise. With crowdfunding, all you need is a story compelling enough to convince people to invest in your business. With VC, you need much more than a good story. You need adequate proof that your business has the potential to grow.Your investment dealVC has been around for decades, while crowdfunding is a fairly new phenomenon. Currently, there are many more VC investments than there are ECF campaigns. But analysts don’t expect the situation to stay that way. In fact, analysts expect crowdfunding campaigns to grow in popularity because their use tripled in 2020. Your reputation Start-ups that are more focused on their social impact are better off raising money through crowdfunding sites. Many investors on crowdfunding sites look for campaigns where their money can make a true difference in the world, such as with the environment or healthcare. VC traditionally funds businesses looking to make a profit — and not a small one, at that.Contact Airwallex to streamline your financesWhether your start-up has received funding through VC or ECF, you need a reliable way to manage your money. Airwallex offers Global Business Accounts that can help you unlock new global markets without losing money in FX fees.Open accounts in 11 currencies at the click of a button, enjoy fast global transfers, market-beating FX rates, and borderless cards.  So no matter where your funding comes from, you can make sure more money remains available for your business endeavours rather than lost in translation. If you’re ready to streamline your finances and improve your profit margins, don’t hesitate to sign up today. Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/a-conversation-with-hubspot-and-airwallex,A Conversation with HubSpot & Airwallex,"BlogA Conversation with HubSpot & Airwallex2 August 2022•5 minutesA conversation with Caitlin Siegrist, Senior Manager of Platform Ecosystems at HubSpot, Eric Bai, Manager of SME Partnerships at Airwallex, and Richard Yu, Product Lead of Ecosystem, Growth, and Lending at Airwallex.Tell us more about Airwallex’s Ecosystem and Strategic Partnerships teamAirwallex (Richard/Eric): The Ecosystem team’s mission is to simplify customer operations and enable novel use cases for small and medium enterprises. We build integrations with supporting software, like accounting, customer relationship management and eCommerce platforms. Our team was formed last year to better serve our customers with a connected product that would help users manage their money confidently with tools they’re already familiar with. Our members work closely with Airwallex’s Strategic Partnerships team responsible for managing relationships with some of the largest tech companies.How did the partnership with HubSpot start?Airwallex: We’re new to the HubSpot ecosystem, but we’ve been a HubSpot customer for quite some time. Our partnership conversation with HubSpot began in earnest earlier this year. While we’d identified HubSpot as a potential partner and had a few preliminary conversations, our Ecosystem product team had been focused on launching integrations with Netsuite, Zapier and Xero. It wasn’t until we took part in the App Accelerator program that we started exploring a possible integration. Their team was seeking out partners as part of their international program, and we realized this was the perfect opportunity for us to look more deeply into an integration.What made the accelerator an especially useful program for Airwallex?Airwallex: A few things stood out to us as we learned more about the accelerator. Firstly, the program provided dedicated developer advocates who helped us investigate HubSpot API endpoints and possible flows for our integration. Secondly, HubSpot’s Partnerships team helped us answer questions about our multi-regional customers’ needs, our core market. And finally, the many co-marketing opportunities we could participate in to help increase awareness of our solution for joint customers.How did the product organization at Airwallex decide to build a direct integration with HubSpot?Airwallex: The accelerator’s required timeline was to design and build an integration in three months. This was the fastest integration built by our team, and it took careful planning and decision-making.We considered working with third-party developers, who we also work with on other integrations. We also assessed the tradeoffs of prioritizing this integration. In order to proceed, we’d likely have to delay building another integration. Ultimately, we decided to move forward with a direct integration based on the size of our existing mutual customer base with HubSpot and our conviction of the opportunity as HubSpot’s partner. Our goal is to provide a great customer experience for HubSpot’s customers.What customer problem is Airwallex trying to solve by building an integration with HubSpot?Airwallex: When you’re a business owner operating across multiple regions, you might find yourself paying unnecessary fees for foreign exchange and payment processing. You might also find your banking system and CRM don’t talk, making it difficult for your finance and sales teams to collect payments and track cash flow. Airwallex, through its integration with HubSpot, offers a single, user-friendly solution for getting paid. The integration uses Airwallex’s shareable, no-code payment links which accept payments in over 170+ local currencies and settle like-for-like into your account. Customers can then use these funds to pay their vendors and expenses. For each deal in HubSpot, the integration creates a payment link unique to the deal and syncs payment events directly to the deal. This saves customers a great deal of time switching between Airwallex and HubSpot, empowers HubSpot Sales Hub users to request and track payments from their customers, and helps finance teams track cash flow while maintaining secure access to the company’s Airwallex account.What makes HubSpot an attractive ecosystem to develop integrations for?Airwallex: HubSpot is a huge player in the CRM space. It has a vast ecosystem of developer and solutions partners which provide real value to its customers. According to IDC, the HubSpot ecosystem is forecast to grow faster than HubSpot as its revenue grows from $4.8 billion in 2020 to $12.5 billion in 2024. Aside from the addressable market, HubSpot’s developer platform and support is a big draw — they’re clearly taking a calculated bet on the success of its partners.Why did HubSpot choose to work with Airwallex for its international app accelerator?HubSpot: Out of several concepts submitted to the accelerator, we found Airwallex’s to be one of the most exciting. Airwallex’s robust payment and FX capabilities are unique for allowing customers to collect payments across multiple currencies and also settle them like-for-like without incurring double currency conversions. This is a large demand gap for companies operating globally and enables them to spend on fees and more on growth. In addition, Airwallex’s large customer base had considerable overlap with HubSpot which made the accelerator an ideal opportunity to partner more closely together.Why is addressing the needs of global and multi-market customers a key priority for HubSpot?HubSpot: While HubSpot’s CRM Platform provides marketing, sales, and customer service capabilities that almost all businesses need, applications like Airwallex provide specialized functionality for companies operating globally. Businesses who operate across different countries face unique challenges including dealing with multiple languages, currencies and payment methods. HubSpot supports over 143,000 companies in more than 120 countries. IDC expects HubSpot customers to become increasingly international, with North American revenue going from nearly 60% of the total in 2020 to under 45% by 2024. The company also has offices all over the world, including recent expansions in Spain, Netherlands and Quebec, Canada. This is a huge area of focus for HubSpot and which is why we’ve made this a key theme for our spring accelerator.What are your future plans for the partnership?Airwallex: Right now, we’re focused on our existing joint customers and educating them on the benefits of the integration. In the future, expect to see more co-marketing efforts between the two companies and exploring deeper ways to partner together. Airwallex will also be expanding the capabilities of our payment link product, such as accepting bank transfers or direct debit. We’ll also be building additional integrations with HubSpot, including Quotes and Marketing Hub.Thanks, any further thoughts?AWX: Read more details about our app in HubSpot’s app marketplace — and if you’re not already an Airwallex customer, you’ll have fees returned on your first $20,000 FX processed when you sign up for a free borderless business account via this link. HubSpot: If you have an app that could connect with HubSpot, we’d love to talk to you about participating in our App Accelerator program.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-hire-for-success-when-youre-an-unknown-startup,How to Hire for Success When You’re an Unknown Startup,"BlogHow to Hire for Success When You’re an Unknown Startup29 July 2022•5 minutesStart-upsBusiness tipsIn this article•What are the challenges of hiring for a start-up?•How to hire employees for your unknown start-up•What to look for in employees•When and whom should you hire?•Creating a hiring process for your start-up•Contact Airwallex to support your startup’s financial endeavorsAs your start-up begins to grow, you’ll likely need to hire more people outside of your founding team. However, that early on, each new hire has the potential to change your business’s DNA. So it’s better to sculpt a strategic hiring process now rather than later if you want to hire for success when you’re an unknown start-up. Because after funding, the biggest hurdle you’ll face is hiring. For start-ups, having the right people in the right roles especially matters. You can’t afford to lose the time when seed funding and other nascent phases of your business are ongoing.What are the challenges of hiring for a start-up?Every stage of growth has unique challenges when hiring for a start-up. But let’s explore the challenges that founders might face during a start-up’s earliest stages. Every hire mattersAs your start-up begins to gain steam, you’ll notice that every hire has an impact on your growth and culture. When your team is still small, new hires influence the quantity and quality of the work you put out. They also affect the team’s culture, capabilities and general morale. Start-ups are high riskJoining a start-up isn’t the right career choice for everyone. Some people prefer more stability, larger teams and greater predictability when it comes to clients and assignments. Others enjoy the fast pace and don’t care so much about the business they work for not having a long, successful track record. This makes finding the right people both easy and difficult. There aren't as many people on the market who enjoy the instability, but at least you know those who come in for interviews or are already hired are there because they truly want to be. You’re unknownAttracting talent — let alone finding talent — is difficult when you’re unknown. Unless your founding members have a reputation and are generally noteworthy, your start-up’s name isn’t going to ring a bell for anyone. You’ll have to really sell your vision and impress not only your investors but also potential candidates who are considering joining your team. How to hire employees for your unknown start-upSo, how do you hire for success when you’re an unknown start-up? The first step is attracting talent. You want to ensure your business attracts top-quality candidates because at the end of the day, your start-up is only as successful as the people you bring on. Build an appealing businessYour earliest team members will likely be people who were all more or less in the same professional network. Hiring remains flexible at this point. But later, you’ll need to build a business that people outside of your immediate network will want to work for. And this doesn’t mean a fancy office or free lunches — it means making your cultural work values clear. Business valuesYour start-up’s values are synonymous with your identity as both an employer and a business overall. It’s best to define those values early so that you start on the right footing and there’s no confusion concerning what you expect from hires. Online presenceBecause you’re likely unknown, at least for the most part, creating an online presence will help you gain an identity in the public eye. Being strategic with what you put on your website and what you post on your social media platforms is essential. And you should keep content consistent among all your outlets. CompensationWhile any talented person will find competitive pay one of the more attractive components of a role, not all hires will put it at the top of their list. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be at the top of yours. In your early stages, most employees will likely be underpaid. Start-ups aren’t rolling in profit yet! But you should plan to bring employees up to market rate as soon as you’re able. Additionally, offering equity will appeal to more applicants. A higher salary is a plus, but it’s common for early employees at a start-up to have equity included in their compensation package. Ownership through equity helps buffer the initially lower pay because it’ll pay off eventually when the business does well and grows its stock. Finding candidatesNetworking and sourcing are equally important when reaching candidates. You should constantly recruit, even if you only have the resources to grow your team bit by bit. You can network by attending conferences, meetups, webinars and talks. This helps you create a real-world foundation for your next potential hire. Sourcing involves directly reaching out to candidates within your immediate and extended network. For example, the people on your current team are there for a reason. And they probably know other people with similar skill sets who may be interested in joining your start-up. Sharing next-hire requirements with your team will allow them to reach out to their contacts and essentially take the recruiting work off your hands. What to look for in employeesHere are some key areas to consider when identifying potential hires.Skill vs attitude It’s tempting to think that the most qualified candidate is the one who has everything you’re looking for on paper: an impressive resume, cover letter, experience and credentials. But sometimes attitude and personality matter more for early teams because a start-up’s nature is usually risky and unpredictable. But it’s also exciting, and it takes a particularly motivated personality to thrive in that environment. Experience vs potentialIt’s always better to hire someone who has a lot of experience rather than someone with little to no experience. But a candidate who misses the mark by just a hair in terms of years of experience could very well have great potential. A candidate with great potential will be highly motivated and excited to learn. Sometimes, a potential hire with the most years of experience won’t have the drive to go beyond the credentials they have. In this case, use your best judgement. Finding someone with the right mix of potential and experience will work best in your favour in the long term.Cultural fitSimilar to personality or attitude, cultural fit isn’t something you can decipher when skimming someone’s resume, cover letter, licences and certificates. But it’s crucial nonetheless.Your earliest employees are integral members of your team. They set the tone for how your start-up will operate. What types of people do you want to work with? What types of people will set the foundation for a healthy cultural standard in the workplace? Once your cultural tone is set, you’ll have a healthier overall workplace — onethat future hires will likely feel comfortable being part of.On that note, it’s advantageous and ethical to hire people who don’t ‘look like you.’ A lack of diversity in the workplace sets your business back. Employees who come from various walks of life, ethnicities and backgrounds will bring their own unique, personal ideas to the forefront. And in turn, that will help you sell products and provide services to all different types of people.When and whom should you hire?Your start-up’s needs will certainly change over time. And what you look for in a candidate will change as well. The hire who works well for your business right now may not work well later. Additionally, your start-up’s type and workload demands will fluctuate. It’s beneficial to.use these factors as references for hires. Whom to hireOnce your start-up begins to grow, your priorities will change. This could mean changes in your product and service offerings or even developmental changes. As a result, the roles you need to fill will change. You might need more people in your software engineering department if you want to focus more of your money and effort on developing a certain product or platform. Or maybe your product is up to par. In that case, you might want to start bringing people into your human resources department because you’re behind in administrative work. When to hireAn important aspect of hiring for your start-up is being selective with timing. If you hire too many people very early, you might be stretched for cash. Or maybe you hire more people than you need, and employees have too much free time. Ultimately, this wastes time and money.Here are a few questions to consider before hiring:Do you have the funds to support a new hire (e.g. training, salary)?Is there enough work to occupy a new hire?Do you have the time to scout and recruit talented prospects?
You’ll typically instinctively know when it’s time to hire because work will pile up. Or maybe your finances are doing well, and you’re no longer struggling with the means to pay your team. If your existing team begins to feel strained, then it’s probably time for you to expand the team. Creating a hiring process for your start-upHere’s a rough outline of how to write a job description for your start-up: A section about your businessA job description summary Perk and compensation detailsOnce you’ve written your job description and candidates start reaching out, you need to do a few things from the point of application to hire. Screen applications: Compare applications to determine who has the required skills based on the job description. Additionally, you can spot any red flags. Give a practical skills test: The skills you test will vary depending on the role. You can distribute a test before, during or after an interview. Interview candidates: Many businesses now have hybrid work environments, so you can conduct interviews either in person or virtually. Interviews are less about quizzing a candidate and more about determining whether they have values and personality traits that mesh with your business’s workplace culture. Pick a candidate: Many businesses will put candidates in a spreadsheet and score them based on cultural fit, skills fit and practical fit (e.g. salary, commute). And as you’d expect, whoever ranks highest is likely the best pick for the job. However, it’s wise to pick a candidate who ranks equally among all aspects — not super high on one and low on others. Contact Airwallex to support your startup’s financial endeavorsBuilding a great team is the biggest indicator of success for your start-up.

This is why entrepreneurs and business owners work to better understand the ins and outs of net working capital. What does it mean? How much do I need? Is it even that important?Once you understand what net working capital is, you can answer all those questions and stabilise your business’s finances. And stability will help your operations not only run smoother but also last for the long term. Closing a business because you made mistakes that you could have easily prevented is never fun. But first things first — net working capital and working capital are synonymous. Both represent the difference between your current liabilities and your current assets. However, some financial analysts define net working capital a little more narrowly than others. Let’s explore the matter.What is working capital?Working capital is what keeps a business up and running while it has expenditures. Most businesses have customers who owe them a little (or a lot of) money. But you can’t always rely on customers to immediately pay you what you’re owed. Nevertheless, the lights need to stay on somehow. That’s what working capital is. It’s the capital your business runs on while you’re both earning and spending money. With working capital, you have the option to restock your inventory after selling goods. This is true even if customers purchase by signing up for payment instalments, so you don’t get everything you’re owed immediately. Your working capital allows you to keep your business operating regardless.Net working capital is quite similar to (if not the same as) working capital, but it has a slightly narrower definition. Net working capital represents the assets you have, not just your on-hand cash. Here are a few examples:Balance in your bank accountAmount of on-hand cash Merchandise inventoryAny financial investmentsYour accounts receivableBoth net working capital and working capital represent your business’s ability to continue operating while also paying its debts. Why does working capital matter?The main goal of any small- to medium-sized business (SMB) or large enterprise is to return money to its investors. When you think about it, it makes sense that investors pay attention to business owners who do more than just keep the lights and water on. Investors look at businesses that have a strong chance of growing and thus earning more in the future. That earned money will eventually flow back to the investor to replace what they funded. Working capital keeps a business up and running, but any entrepreneur understands that the net working capital amount determines a business’s debt capacity. Or in other words, how much is this business really worth? And if it needs to handle debt down the road, what can it liquidate to pay it off?Net working capital and working capital also determine the direction an investment should go and whether suppliers can influence negotiations. How to calculate working capitalNow that you know what working capital is and why it matters, let’s look into how to calculate it.First, you have to identify your current assets and liabilities. But what exactly are they?Current assetsIn accounting terms, a current asset is a business’s cash, as well as all the goods it has that it can convert into cash within a short period (12 months). This also includes incoming earnings.When you look at a business’s balance sheet, you’ll find its liquidity, with each asset having a unique liquidation amount.Here are examples of current assets:Cash. This includes the money in your bank account as well as checks or other forms of customer payment that you haven’t deposited yet.Accounts receivable. Your total accounts receivables is the money you’re currently owed and receiving through accounts minus the allowances that likely won’t be paid.Notes receivable. This could be short-term loans (ones that expire within one year) to suppliers or customers.Other receivables. These include any cash advances you give to employees, insurance claims and income tax refunds. Short-term investments. These usually entail investments that a business intends to sell within 12 months.Marketable securities. This includes money market funds or US Treasury bills.Inventory. This indicates raw materials (e.g. textiles), works in progress and finished goods.Prepaid expenses and advance payments. This could mean prepaid insurance premiums or purchases you’ve set in place for the future.
As for liabilities, which are on a separate part of a balance sheet, you’ll see short-term debts (again, within a 12-month period). These liabilities usually refer to payments you owe suppliers, your taxes, any financial charges and more. Here are examples of current liabilities:Accounts payableNotes payable (within 12 months)Taxes payableWages payableLoan interest payableLoan principal owed within one yearVariable accrued expensesAdvance customer payments for any goods or services that have yet to be delivered (e.g. deferred revenue)
Here’s the working capital formula:Current assets − Current liabilities = Working capital.If your result is in the negative, this means your business will likely need to pursue third-party capital (such as a bank loan) to pay any outstanding debts. Advantages of working capital Next, we’ll examine some advantages of working capital.Ensures liquidityBusinesses often experience financial hardship when they have an ineffective working capital management policy. Working capital management monitors accounts payable and receivable, stocks, debt and more to ensure liquidity in the business. If the business needs cash for any short-term debts or operations, it’s available at any time.Avoids operational interruptionWorking capital allows you to keep your operations moving without any stops. Better yet, detailed information about your working capital (e.g. how much you have) allows you to make sound business decisions concerning where to put your time and money. Ultimately, this knowledge gives you an advantage over your competitors. Increases profitProperly applying your working capital allows you to increase your profit in the long run. This is because you can better manage your inventory and thus avoid failure in your operations. Collecting and paying trade receivables on time are key aspects of managing your working capital, too. That’s because you’re properly allocating cash and managing what comes in before it goes out. Improves financial stabilityBecause working capital is essentially an assessment of money going in and out, you can better allocate your business’s cash. Working capital also allows business owners to avoid legal troubles that may arise if they lack enough of it. When you have more than enough working capital, you can unlock opportunities that may otherwise be unavailable. Limitations of working capital Here, we’ll delve into some limitations of working capital.Only monetary Working capital includes only items of monetary value, such as finished goods, debts receivables and more. When determining your working capital, you don’t consider nonmonetary items such as the impact of recessions and governmental policies affecting your particular industry. Non-situationalWorking capital is naturally non-situational. It takes time to respond to any changes in the market, and working capital doesn’t acknowledge the impact it takes on profit due to slower business operations.Data-based Working capital relies on data, so your strategy holds no relevance without concrete numbers. One example is with trade receivables. You need your date of sale, number of days in a grace period, penalty amount for unfulfilled payments and more. Example of working capitalLet’s say your total current assets equal $740,000. This includes cash, finished inventory, raw materials and accounts receivable. However, your current liabilities equal $405,000. This might be for employee wages, business taxes, office rent, utilities, subscriptions and any debts due within the year. Your working capital would then total $335,000. Following the formula above, your current assets amount ($740,000) minus your current liabilities amount ($405,000) equals your working capital ($335,000).What does negative working capital mean for your business?Several risks accompany lack of control over your working capital. Your cash can become negative, which threatens the efficiency and stability of your overall operations. It’s vital that you prevent a deficit in your current assets to ensure your balance remains positive. Here are some tips to help you maintain a positive current asset value: Know your business’s financial cycle and cash flow (what’s coming in and what’s going out).Document all your business processes so that you have content and data to reference if things go wrong.Control defaulters.Instate a policy that controls the reduction of your expenses and costs.
Negative working capital could result in laying off workers, paying suppliers late or shutting down warehouses or stores. That’s why you want to ensure your current assets remain positive, and doing so requires favourable business conditions.This will help you meet customers’ needs, maintain trusted relationships with suppliers and vendors, and keep up with market growth.How to improve your working capitalIf your working capital starts to decrease from a lack of sales, or if you want to increase it for project-related reasons, it’s time to think of ways to improve it.You can improve your working capital in one or two ways:Reducing your current liabilitiesIncreasing your current assetsOne way to increase your current assets is by taking on long-term debt. The word “debt” might seem frightening, but long-term debt will actually increase your current assets by adding to your business’s available cash and not drastically increasing your current liabilities. To reduce your current liabilities, you can also refinance your short-term debt to long-term debt. Because your debt is no longer due within a 12-month period, your current liabilities will decrease.Another way to increase your current assets is to sell non-liquid assets for cash. And as stated earlier, when you have more cash, you have more working capital.We recommend managing your inventory well to reduce potential overstocking as well as to decrease the likelihood of your business writing off items. This relates to reducing your overall expenses, which in turn reduces your current liabilities. Additionally, we suggest automating your payment monitoring and accounts receivable. As a result, your cash flow will increase, and you won’t have to dig into your working capital as often to cover your day-to-day operations. Expand your business whilst reducing costs with AirwallexIf you’re looking for a reliable, cost-effective and efficient way to streamline your finances and improve your profit margins, sign up for a free Global Business Account with Airwallex. Our multi-currency account aligns with more than 11 currencies, which makes it easier than ever to manage your money domestically and internationally.

But sometimes it’s difficult to pinpoint which areas are thriving and which need improvement. Choosing your North Star Metric is a great place to start. It’ll help you better measure your progress, reflect on your customer value and ultimately boost your revenue. What is a North Star metric?A North Star metric is a measurement that accurately predicts a business’s success — specifically its long-term potential. One of the key aspects of North Star metrics is that they may vary among businesses. What one business deems its North Star metric might differ significantly from that of another. However, your business isn’t excluded to only one metric. Most large businesses have one to three North Star metrics, but smaller operations are fine with just one. It all depends on the business’s type, size and goals. A good North Star metric will accomplish these actions:Lead to revenueReflect customer valueMeasure progressAdditionally, business owners rely on a North Star metric to determine goals and other more specific metrics for individual product teams. The metric helps you define the relationship between your customers and your products. And once you define that relationship, you can point out any gaps or weak areas for your product team to improve and thus better satisfy customers and earn more revenue.North Star metric examplesAs stated above, a North Star metric varies depending on a business’s size, type and goals. But the key aspect is that it isn’t the same for every business. It can be, but every business and its teams have their own sets of goals to reach, even if they’re competitors. One example is a tech North Star metric — Facebook. The social media platform’s North Star metric is the number of monthly active users. By contrast, Airbnb’s metric is the number of nights booked. Depending on your area of business, let’s say sales engagement, your North Star metric could be the number of new subscribers or the number of new accounts opened. Or let’s say a business like Instacar wants to focus its North Star metric on new user activation. The number of weekly users completing a first order could very well be its ideal North Star metric to indicate future revenue. Or, an eCommerce North Star metric might be the number of mobile orders delivered. An eCommerce business might have a current strategy focused on increasing orders through its mobile app, with customers having a satisfactory buying experience. This could mean no returns, easy payment methods and generally no complaints. A business-to-business (B2B) north star metric or a software as a service (SaaS) North Star metric might rely on HubSpot or Dropbox. This North Star metric could be four active users in week two after starting a trial account. This metric allows the B2B company to determine whether free trial accounts are useful, or in other words, whether the strategy turns leads into customers.  Why choosing a North Star metric is importantChoosing a North Star metric is important because it helps you better understand your business’s overall position. Consider it a sort of bird’s-eye view. When you can visualize where things currently are, then you can determine what’s doing well, what’s not doing so well and what could use a nudge in a different direction. This not only sets you on a smarter path to success but also improves employee retention. Your team will have a better understanding of the business at large as well as where it’s going. What employee wouldn’t want to be at a business that’s growing successfully on the up and up rather than at a standstill? Reduced turnover keeps your business on stable ground so you aren’t constantly training new members. North Star metric frameworkAny North Star metric should consist of two parts:A statement explaining your product or business visionA metric representing the key measure for achieving your vision Once you have a vision, you can determine the metric(s) you want to focus on. Most businesses focus on one of three:Transaction — the number of commercial transactions users or customers make on your platformProductivity — the number of valued digital tasks customers can perform on your platform or product Attention — the amount of time you can engage customers with your product or on your platformSo, you have your vision and metric and now you can start strategizing. How to define your North Star metricNow that you know what a North Star metric is, let’s explore how to define yours. The most important aspect to consider when determining your North Star metric is the game you want to play, or in other words, the area(s) you want to focus on. There are generally six categories of North Star metrics. This list represents the most to least common ones: Revenue — the amount of money you’re bringing inCustomer growth — the number of customers your business has Consumption growth — how often customers use your productEngagement growth — the number of active customers you haveGrowth efficiency — the efficiency of how much money you earn vs. spendUser experience — how engaging or easy your product is to customersMost businesses focus on revenue because increased profit is the most noticeable indicator of growth. But examining your revenue balance sheets will ultimately help you determine whether you're meeting your desired profit numbers.Taking a look at the back end of your business will also give you clarity on where there’s room for improvement. This could mean data showing your number of product users or how long they stay on your site.North Star metric vs. OKRSo, you might be wondering what the difference is between a North Star metric and objective and key results (OKR). Well, OKR is a method that synchronizes a business’s goals on an individual level to a global scale. OKR helps businesses determine and set goals on a quarterly basis. An OKR file has four categories:Global — These are large-scale business goals decided on a quarterly basis. Units — A business’s departmental leaders will decide which goals they’ll take on and decide which teams will help them achieve those goals. Teams — Teams will determine the direction they want to take and which projects will help them reach a goal. Persons — Each team member will determine which project they can undertake to help achieve the overall goals. A North Star metric helps your business stay aligned with its OKR. Without a clear vision determined by OKR, it’s infeasible to decide your North Star metric. In other words, a North Star metric and OKR aren’t synonymous, but they work with each other to help goals remain clear and to know what to measure when working towards those goals. When to adapt your North Star metricBefore adapting a North Star metric, your business must have the right culture and infrastructure in place. You need to ensure you have aligned expectations and punctual communication within your business before moving forward with your North Star metric. If there’s no willingness to prioritize the business (its team, goals, and success), then there’s no use in working towards your North Star metric. For example, if you work for a commission-based sales business, sales teams and their compensation might present a conflict of interest when working towards a collective goal. The bottom line is to ensure everyone on your team has clear responsibilities, is collaborative and motivated when tending to those responsibilities and has the common goal for the business to excel. When you think about it, if a business isn’t successful, then that usually means its team isn't, either. And who doesn’t want to be successful?Contact AirwallexAchieving your North Star metric allows you to effectively scale your business.

I hear you ask. Whilst there are several business KPIs that can be used to track the success of your marketing, product and sales initiatives, there are a handful of core business metrics that offer a birds eye view of your company’s progress towards exponential growth.   These are the numbers that venture capitalists will look at when deciding whether to invest in your startup. They are the metrics that you should discuss in your board meetings and with your employees. They will help you pinpoint and fix the fault lines in your strategy, and ensure that your company continues in a straight line towards sustainable profit. If you ever find yourself stuck in an elevator with an angel investor, these are the metrics you want to know off the top of your head. The North Star MetricThe term ‘North Star Metric’ was first coined by startup investor Sean Ellis. In his own words, the point of the North Star Metric is: “to align everyone on your team to work together to grow it.”Your North Star Metric is a way of ensuring that everyone in your company is moving towards a common goal. If a project is not contributing to the North Star Metric, there’s a high chance your employees shouldn’t be working on it.  Silicon Valley leaders use the North Star Metric to prioritise projects and efficiently assign resources. For example, the North Star Metric at Meta is ‘monthly active users’. This metric sits at the top of Meta’s strategy, and all their initiatives contribute in some way towards improving it. When choosing your North Star Metric, it’s important to look at the big picture. Take for example a SaaS business which generates revenue through a monthly subscription model. The founders of this business might choose ‘monthly sign ups’ as their North Star Metric, and congratulate themselves on a job well done. Following this North Star Metric, the marketing team could decide to put all resources into driving sign-ups to a free trial. This isn’t necessarily a bad strategy, and would certainly increase interest in the product, but problems will arise if the free trials never convert to paid subscriptions.    For this reason ‘monthly sign ups’, whilst an important metric, may not be the best North Star for the business, as it only provides one half of the overall goal.  The best North Star Metrics offer a clear picture of a company’s overarching objective. They should be simple to understand, easy to track, and align with your company mission. [Related: Choosing your North Star Metric]
Cash Burn Rate Cash burn rate is a measurement of how quickly your business is spending (or burning through) money. It’s a particularly critical business metric for startups, which are likely to be operating at a loss in their early years.  Burn rate is used for calculating cash runway—that’s the amount of time your business has left before it runs out of money. Venture-backed businesses use burn rate and cash runway when planning their funding rounds. In turn, investors use burn rate as an indication of how wisely a business is spending its money. Running out of money is the number one reason startups fail, and no venture capitalist wants to invest in a doomed project, but that doesn’t mean you should aim for the slowest cash burn rate possible. In fact, VCs are likely to view a sluggish burn rate as a red flag, as it could indicate that you aren’t investing money in your business’ growth.
There are two ways to calculate cash burn rate:1. Gross burn rate: this is the amount your company is spending on operating costs each month. It does not take into account your revenue. 

The formula for gross burn rate is:Operating costs / number of months = gross burn rate
2. Net burn rate: this is the amount of money your company is losing each month. Net burn rate takes your revenue into account. So if you’re spending a lot, but also making a lot of money back in revenue, your net burn rate will be mitigated. You should always use net burn rate when calculating your cash runway. 

The formula is:

(Starting balance - ending balance) / number of months = net burn rateUltimately, managing cash burn rate means finding the right balance between profitability and growth. As a founder, you need to decide whether to retain your profits, or invest them back into your business. [Related: How to calculate cash burn rate the right way!]

With an Airwallex account, you can collect customer payments in multiple currencies without paying high FX or transaction fees. Meaning you can scale your business globally without the associated costs.

Negative working capital suggests that a company does not have enough cash to pay off its debts and continue running with the same operational costs. A company with negative working capital may have to sell its assets and cut its operational costs or risk bankruptcy.  To calculate working capital, you subtract your current liabilities (money that will need to be paid within the next 12 months, including staff wages, accounts payable and tax) from your current assets (assets that you have or expect to receive within the next 12 months, including accounts receivable, unsold inventory and cash).  The formula looks like this: Current assets - current liabilities = working capitalAs with cash burn rate, both high and low working capital can be a cause for concern. Negative working capital indicates that a company is in financial difficulty, but a high working capital could mean a company isn’t making the most of its available assets or investing in long-term growth. [Related: Net working capital: How to calculate it and why it's important]Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is a measurement of how much money it takes for your business to win a new customer. CAC is an important metric in business performance management, as it indicates whether your sales and marketing strategy is working efficiently.The formula for calculating CAC is:

Cost of sales and marketing / number of new customers acquired = CACWhen calculating CAC, you should include sales and marketing spend, salaries, bonuses and overheads.   CAC is an important metric for any business that uses sales and marketing to generate new customers. That includes eCommerce businesses, professional services, and even bricks and mortar businesses such as supermarkets. Ultimately, the less you spend on acquiring new customers, the greater your profit margins will be. When looking at CAC, it’s important to think about the lifetime value (or CLV) of the customers you acquire. This is an obvious consideration for SaaS businesses and other enterprises that collect recurring revenue from their customers, but CLV can also be applied to other businesses. For example, an eCommerce business has a CAC of £50, and the average order value on their website is £55. This low margin initially causes concern, but after analysing the data, the business finds that a large percentage of its customer base return to make further purchases. Using this data, the business finds that the average customer lifetime value is £800, thereby justifying their CAC.   
Customer lifetime valueCustomer lifetime value (CLV) is a performance metric that measures the revenue your customers bring in throughout their relationship with your business.It costs more money to acquire new customers than it does to keep existing ones, so increasing CLV is an obvious lever to pull to maximise the profitability of your business. CLV also offers a good insight into your customer satisfaction. If your customers continue to use your products over an extended period of time, it means you’re doing something right.You can use CLV to determine whether your customer acquisition cost (CAC) is justified, and when deciding your pricing strategy. The formula for calculating customer lifetime value is:Annual customer value x average customer lifespan in years =  CLVIn order to measure CLV, you need to understand your customer lifecycle. If you own an eCommerce business, that means tracking the purchase frequency of your returning customers. If you own a subscription business, it means understanding your upsells, cross sells and churn rate. [Related: Stop overlooking customer lifetime value in eCommerce]Payback periodsAs a founder, it can be difficult to decide which initiatives to invest in. Should you put your budget into developing a new product? Or should you spend money on equipment that will help your team work more efficiently?  Payback periods allow you to calculate the opportunity and risk associated with an investment. The shorter the payback period, the better the investment. The formula for calculating payback period is:Investment / annual cashflow from investment = payback period Payback period is a useful metric to use when building a business plan, as it helps you prioritise where to spend your budget. [Related: Determining payback periods: How to plan for startup success]Gross, operating and net profit marginProfit margin shows the revenue your company has retained after expenses have been accounted for, and offers a clear indication of the growth potential of your business.   There are three ways to calculate profit margin, and all of them are usually expressed as a percentage. Gross profit marginGross profit margin shows the percentage of revenue that remains after accounting for cost of goods sold (COGS).The formula for calculating gross profit margin is:(Gross profit / revenue) x 100 = gross profit marginOperating profit marginOperating profit margin shows the percentage of revenue that remains after accounting for operating, administrative, sales and overhead costs. The formula for calculating operating profit margin is:(Operating income / revenue) x 100 = operating profit margin
Net profit marginNet profit margin is your bottom line. This is the amount of revenue you have left after accounting for all expenses, including operating costs, overheads, COGS, tax, one off expenses and debt repayments. The formula for calculating net profit margin is:(Net income / revenue) x 100 = net profit marginProfitability metrics vary by industry, so it’s best to benchmark your business against others in your sector. You can also use profitability metrics to understand how your business is performing YOY. 🌎 Top tip: Airwallex helps startup founders scale their business globally whilst improving profit margins.

Net revenue retention Net revenue retention (NRR) is a key performance metric for SaaS businesses and other companies that operate under a recurring revenue model. It shows the percentage of revenue retained from existing customers over a period of time. NRR takes into account your monthly recurring revenue, the additional revenue you have generated from upselling and cross selling to your existing customers, and the revenue you have lost from customers that have churned or downgraded their subscription plan.  NRR is a great way to measure customer success and establish the profitability of your pricing models.  The formula for calculating NRR is:[(total revenue + expansion revenue) – churn] / total revenue = NRR[Related: Net revenue retention and the 3 things every venture capitalist looks for]Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is another key performance metric for SaaS businesses, streaming services, and other companies that follow a recurring revenue model. MRR provides a simple and effective way to measure your business’ growth, and predict future cash flow. If your MRR isn’t moving in the right direction, you may have an issue with customer churn, in which case you should look into ways to improve customer satisfaction and product market fit. In order to calculate MRR, you first need to know your average revenue per user (ARPU). Once you have this, the formula is simple:Monthly ARPU x number of monthly users = MRRChurn rateChurn rate is the main metric which SaaS companies and other businesses that follow a monthly recurring revenue model use to measure customer success. Simply put, churn measures the number of customers that stop using your product or service over a period of time. The lower your churn rate, the higher your customer retention, and the more monthly recurring revenue (MRR) you will make. Churn rate is expressed as a percentage, the formula is:(Customers at the beginning of the month - customers at the end of the month) / customers at the beginning of the month = churn rateAs a startup founder it’s essential that you keep a close eye on your churn rate. All businesses experience some churn, but if your churn rate is creeping up MOM, you may need to assess the value that you are offering your customers versus competitors. Remember, it costs more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing ones, so keeping churn rate low should always be a priority. Improve profit margins and scale your business with Airwallex The key to running a successful business is to grow and retain your customers whilst keeping profit margins high.  Here’s where Airwallex can give you an advantage over competitors. Airwallex helps thousands of startup founders streamline their finances and push into new markets whilst cutting out needless costs.Whether you’re looking to expand your eCommerce business internationally, build a market-leading FX rate into your SaaS product, or simply cut the cost of international payments, Airwallex can help you do it. With an Airwallex account, you can collect customer revenue in multiple currencies without being subject to forced FX conversions or unnecessary fees, adding up to 4% back into your bottom line. You can also cut the cost of paying international suppliers with our bank-beating FX rates, and enjoy borderless spending with our virtual and physical Employee Cards. Airwallex is your complete financial suite for global money management.

We all want to get more done more efficiently to better use our time and resources.However, productivity plays an especially essential role for small to medium enterprises (SMEs), which are generally more resource-strapped than larger businesses. While the benefits of greater productivity are numerous, they tend to fall into three main categories. Increasing productivity in turn improves an SME’s:Profitability: Optimising resources means that your business can maintain the same output with a lower investment of time and money. This both reduces costs and increases profit.Employee satisfaction: Being overloaded leads to employee burnout. Working efficiently, on the other hand, enables employees to stay on top of their responsibilities and manage their workloads well. This in turn improves employee well-being, morale, and engagement.Customer service: Customers don’t like having to wait for the products and services they’ve purchased or the answers and information they’ve requested. However, being able to give them the time and attention they deserve makes for better customer service and greater customer loyalty.4 Ways to increase productivity in a businessBusinesses tend to think big when it comes to saving time. the bigger the change the more time saved, right?Not necessarily. When it comes to increasing productivity, sometimes the smallest improvements bring the most significant results.We recommend looking at these four key areas to find quick wins that will maximise your productivity.Storage setupThere’s nothing more frustrating than when you’re on a roll and the need to search for a file or document brings your progress to a halt. And this problem is more than an occasional roadblock.In a 2021 survey of US office professionals by Wakefield Research and Elastic, 54% of respondents said wasting time searching for necessary documents and files was a problem.A cloud storage service such as Google Drive or Dropbox can eliminate these issues, enabling you to organise documents in easily accessible files:
Never waste time searching by keyword again. Easily access the documents you’re looking for by opening the appropriate client or project file.Enable file sharing. Share files and folders with coworkers and clients in seconds.Access documents on the go. Carrying a jump drive, logging in to a content management system (CMS), and even connecting to WiFi are no longer requirements for accessing documents.Say goodbye to versioning headaches. No need to worry if you’re working with the most recent version, or upload new versions to a CMS.Expense managementManually submitting and approving receipts isn’t only incredibly mundane, it’s also inefficient and error-prone.Luckily, the proper tool can save you the time (and energy) of expense management while also eliminating the risk of human error.For instance, Airwallex makes things easier from the beginning by allowing you to create individual Employee Debit Cards for  your team in a click.  Use our Expenses feature to submit, review and approve expenses in moments , and efficiently log and categorise transactions so that mystery purchases are a thing of the past.Additional features that can help save time include real-time notifications of card transactions and changes to your account balances via SMS, email, or Slack, as well as card spending limits for specific use cases.Essentially, you no longer have to worry about  chasing down receipts or manually  processing  each expense — we’ll do the hard work for you.Client onboarding Signing a new client is great news — until you have to do all of the monotonous tasks associated with client onboarding.First, we recommend developing and using questionnaires and intake forms to get the information you need while minimising the back and forth. There’s no need for email chains when a single document will get the job done.While that alone will save you a good deal of time, there’s even more you can do. For example, online automation tool Zapier enables you to automatically save the results from your client onboarding forms to the appropriate folder in your cloud storage. Then use Zapier to auto-generate a contact and payment link for your new client, so that you have everything you need when it comes time to contact or charge them.Inventory managementProper inventory management is crucial. Too little stock on hand can  mean you’re unable to meet customer demand and fulfil purchases. Too much can waste space in your warehouse and result in dead stock that you can’t sell.But knowing how much inventory you have at any given moment is easier said than done. Tracking with pen and paper or even with spreadsheets gets complicated and confusing fast. It’s not the most accurate, and it’s certainly not efficient.That’s why tools like NetSuite Inventory Management are so effective. Get a real-time view of all of your inventory, across all of your sales channels and locations, with a single dashboard. NetSuite even provides tools to help you optimise your inventory levels, ensuring you can meet customer expectations while also minimising inventory costs.

Thanks to Airwallex’s remote-first approach in the U.S., and my husband’s flexibility as an entrepreneur, we had our choice of locations to live, and are so glad we picked San Diego! In my free time, I enjoy going on some of the gorgeous hikes the city has to offer, trying out new restaurants and breweries, and taking my son to the zoo. What were you doing prior to joining Airwallex?Prior to my move to Airwallex and San Diego in August 2021, I worked at Citi for ten years, starting in New York and then relocating to Singapore for the last four years. Most of my time there was spent in commercial card issuing, and I learned a ton, not only about issuing, but also about enterprise sales and navigating internal stakeholders. Before Citi, I got my Bachelors and Masters from Georgetown University in Washington, DC. I am a big Georgetown basketball fan–even though we had a historically awful season this year. Nowhere to go but up! Tell us about your work here at Airwallex.I am an Enterprise Account Executive in our Platform side of the business. This means that I work with large companies who are interested in leveraging our capabilities via API. Many of my customers want to embed or white-label our services on their own platforms, using our Scale solution. One of the most interesting parts of the role is being able to sell across our entire suite of products–from payouts to issuing to FX–and figure out how to bring these capabilities together to create a holistic solution for our clients. The breadth of products and geographies that Airwallex covers means I’m always learning new things and constantly being challenged, in a (mostly!) good way. These are big, complex deals with long sales cycles, but the satisfaction of seeing a marquee customer go live after putting in is so worth it. You’re working on a novel in your spare time, right?Yes, I am working on a murder mystery novel! After I came back to work from maternity leave in February 2021, I felt like all I thought about was my work and my baby. I needed a creative outlet and something for me to focus on that was just for me. I sat down and brainstormed all of my favorite things, and how to incorporate them into one story. The two top items on the list were murder mysteries and my ultimate guilty pleasure, The Bachelor franchise. Thus the concept for my novel was born! Here’s the working description I have for the book: At a luxury resort in sunny Mexico, cast and crew come together to film the popular reality dating show, Love’s a Beach. Presumably, the contestants are hoping to fall in love, and the producers are hoping to create a blockbuster season. However, when one cast member is found dead, those plans are dashed, and everyone’s motives come into question. Secrets begin to unravel, revealing backstories and motivations through the eyes of the showrunner, a producer, and a fellow contestant. Love, revenge, jealousy, and self-preservation intertwine in the race to discover who wanted him dead, and who had the means to kill him. I finished my first draft in March, a year after I started. I’m currently working through my first round of edits, and plan to start seeking out an agent soon. I’d love to find a publisher, but will also be happy to self-publish and just get my writing out into the world. How would you describe Airwallex in a few words to potential candidates?Collaborative - I really enjoy the partnership between sales and the other functional groups - product, ops, legal, etc. The teams listen to each other and take feedback, then work together to secure new customers and make them successful once on board. For example, I had a customer who, in order to move forward with us, wanted a new feature committed to be launched by a specific timeline. Given potential revenue and the importance of the account, our product team reshuffled priorities to meet the client’s ask. We won the deal and they’re currently integrating with us. Challenging - A lot of what we’re working on is very cutting edge–the first time we’re trying a new global model, launching products in new markets, etc. As mentioned above, my internal partners are very collaborative and supportive, but there is still a ton to figure out. For me, this is the fun part of the role, and what I know will keep things interesting for me, even as I develop more and more expertise in the products themselves. This type of ongoing challenge and ability to come up with creative solutions is an important quality in a role for me. Exciting - There are lots of exciting things happening all the time at this company! There was a fundraising round announced a month after I joined, then again two months later. There are constantly new products and geographies launching. It feels like every month a new marquee prospect wants to engage with us. I think that positive momentum and camaraderie amongst AirBuddies is a huge part of what has made this such an enjoyable ride so far. Looking to take the next step in your career?

It really sent everyone spinning – suddenly, we were confined to work remotely, and much of what made my job as a consultant fun and exciting was no longer there. I had always wanted to try working in a start-up and fast growth environment where everyone is working towards the same goal. I wanted to have more ownership over the things that I do. I also knew I wanted to go somewhere different, where I could put myself in an environment that would really motivate me to learn and grow. And it was around that time when I heard about Airwallex. Some of the people I knew had moved into Airwallex to work, and I also heard about Airwallex being one of the fastest growing fintechs. It all fit for me – start-up, fast growth environment and being able to work in Hong Kong. What was so attractive about moving to Hong Kong? How has it been living here? I got the chance to spend some time in Hong Kong back in 2014 for an exchange program, and really loved the city. When I saw the job posting in Hong Kong for Airwallex, I was all for it. There is such a unique, international vibe. Being a place of “contrasts” is a good word to describe the city – you can be in a traditional fishing village one minute, and among sky-high skyscrapers the next. Or, you can be sitting in a crowded bar and dealing with highly congested streets, and just a short bus ride later, find yourself immersed in nature among Hong Kong’s rolling mountains. I will say that I miss riding my bike everywhere - something that’s a bit more challenging in a densely populated city like Hong Kong! I know this might be a hard question to answer but… what does a typical day at Airwallex look like?That’s a difficult one… I don’t think it exists! But that’s why it’s so exciting and fun here. It’s about being able to solve the problems and identifying the best possible ways to support our global customer base. If I had to summarize a day though, it would be a combination of analyzing troughs of data, brainstorming and learning sessions with colleagues around the world, as well as taking part in special projects and initiatives that aim to solve our customer pain points. What’s one of your favorite memories during your time at Airwallex? We always do a quarterly kick-off with the whole business accounts team. We take the time to review our performance, set new targets and discuss future strategies. We also use this opportunity to celebrate the team’s accomplishments together.One of the highlights was during our September kick-off last year, where the team proposed we do an Oktoberfest-themed celebration. We went to a German restaurant, and I had worn “tracht"", a traditional Bavarian clothing. Usually I'm learning about Hong Kong food and culture so this was a nice chance for me to share my background and culture with the rest of the team, which was pretty cool.Outside of work, what is something that you enjoy doing?I think taking breaks is important, especially when you are working in a high-growth environment like ours. We’re all so excited and eager to keep pushing forward that you almost have to sometimes tell yourself to take a breather. So, I do make a point to take-off proper breaks and use the opportunity to travel. One of the more memorable trips I’ve had is traveling through the Trans-Siberian Railway. And lastly, any advice to people who have just joined (or want to join) a startup?It’s about asking the questions. Don’t be afraid to ask! It’s the most effective way to understand the business and to help you learn and grow quickly. Looking to take the next step in your career?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-calculate-burn-rate,How to calculate burn rate (the right way!),"BlogHow to calculate burn rate (the right way!)Tilly Michell23 May 2022•5 minutesFinanceStart-upsBusiness tipsIn this article•How to calculate burn rate •Gross Burn Rate vs Net Burn Rate•Gross burn rate formula•Net burn rate formula•How to calculate cash runway•What is a “good” burn rate for startups?•How long should your cash runway be?•How to improve burn rate•Spend less on fees and more on growth with AirwallexBurn rate is a measurement of how fast your business is spending (or burning through) cash. It’s an important metric for all companies, but particularly for startups which are more likely to be operating at a loss in their first years of growth. Burn rate is used to calculate cash runway—that’s the amount of time your business has left before it runs out of money. Venture-backed businesses use burn rate to determine when they need to plan their next funding round. In turn, investors use burn rate to measure the financial health of a business, and gauge whether it’s a good idea to put in money.   Ultimately, managing burn rate is a balancing act between profitability and growth. A fast burn rate could be a red flag if your business doesn’t have a solid plan for reaching profitability in the future. A slow burn rate could indicate that your business isn’t making the most of its available capital, and is likely to be overtaken by more aggressive competitors. In this article, we’ll explain how to calculate gross and net burn rate the right way. We’ll also show you how to work out your cash runway, and I’ll take a look at how successful startup founders manage burn rate in the early years of their business. How to calculate burn rate The best way to calculate burn rate is over a quarterly, six-month or annual period. Measuring burn rate over shorter periods can throw back misleading data if your spending and revenue varies from month to month. For example, if your business spends $500,000 in January, $100,000 in February and $700,000 in March, you’ll want to look at spending across all three months to get an accurate view of your burn rate for the year so far. You can find all the information you need to measure burn rate on your cash flow statements. But before you get your calculator out, you need to decide whether you’re measuring gross or net burn rate.Gross Burn Rate vs Net Burn RateThe difference between gross and net burn is simple. Gross burn tells you the amount your company is spending on operating costs such as staff salaries, rent and equipment, per month. It does not take revenue into account. Net burn shows you how much money your company is losing per month. It takes your company’s spending and revenue into account. So, if your company is spending a lot but also generating sales, the revenue you’ve made will mitigate your net burn rate.  Net burn rate is the metric you should use when calculating your cash runway. Gross burn rate formulaTo measure your average monthly gross burn rate over a set period of time, the formula is:Expenses / Number of Months = Gross Burn RateFor example, Awesome Tech Ltd decide to calculate their average gross burn rate over Q1. The company's operational expenses from January - March total $573,000. They apply the following formula:573,000 / 3 = 191,000Their average gross burn rate for the quarter is $191,000 per month.  Net burn rate formulaTo calculate net burn rate over a set period, take your cash balance at the beginning of the period and subtract the cash balance at the end of the period, then divide by the number of months in that period.  

The formula looks like this:(Starting Balance - Ending Balance) / Number of Months = Burn RateFor example, Cool Horses Inc decide to calculate their net burn rate for the first 6 months of the year.  They look at their financial statement and see that at the start of Q1 their cash balance was $1m. At the end of Q2, their cash balance stands at $400,000. They apply the following formula:(1,000,000 - 400,000) / 6 = 100,000Cool Horses Inc’s net burn rate is $100,000 a month. How to calculate cash runwayStartups often take a few years to become profitable, so having a high net burn shouldn’t necessarily concern you. What should concern you is your cash runway. Your cash runway tells you how many months you have left before your company runs out of money. Once you’ve calculated your net burn, working out your cash runway is easy. Take your cash balance and divide it by your net burn rate. The result is the number of months you have in your cash runway. The formula is:Cash Balance / Net Burn Rate = Cash RunwayFor example, Love Dating App has a current balance of £200,000. Their net burn rate is £50,000 a month. They apply this formula to work out their cash runway:200,000 / 50,000 = 4 If Love Dating App doesn't generate more revenue, secure investment, or cut back on spending, they’ll run out of cash in four months! ✅Top tip: a smart way to reduce burn rate without impacting productivity is to put the right financial infrastructure in place. Sign up for a free Airwallex account and spend less on fees and more on growth, with free international transfers, bank-beating FX rates, and 0% domestic or international card fees. What is a “good” burn rate for startups?Where you are in your growth journey will affect your decision making when it comes to establishing a target burn rate. An established business may want to limit spend and retain profit in order to pay out dividends to shareholders. Whilst a startup is likely to invest profits back into the business in order to stimulate growth.Burn rate is a metric that venture capitalists keep a close eye on. But that doesn’t mean your aim should be to spend as little as possible. In fact, investors want to know that you’re spending on growth in order to generate future profits.  If your business has plenty of cash in the bank that you’re afraid to use, investors may question your judgement and long term ambitions.Alexej Pikovsky is a former investment banker and the CEO and Co-Founder Alphagreen Group, an Amazon aggregator founded in 2019. ""Our investors were more interested in growth than profits,” says Pikovsky. “We never drove growth at all costs, but tried to grow sustainably at all times. We were initially focused on building the infrastructure and the product aggressively, while we are now focused on pushing the product and the services out to generate more sales.”Ben Brading is a chartered accountant and the founder of AquaSwitch. ""Angel investors and Venture Capital funds are very comfortable with the idea of a big cash burn,"" says Brading. ""When raising funds, you'll present a business plan where you'll forecast your cash burn month by month.  As long as there are no nasty surprises for investors, the cash burn will be no problem.  Investors are more concerned with hitting big milestones and revenue growth.""That said, the fact that 38% of startups fail because they run out of cash is a sobering thought. No investor wants to plough money into a business that doesn't have a clear path to profitability. Anna Morrish is the Founder and Owner of award-winning digital marketing business Quibble. As an experienced marketer, she often notices other agencies and startups promoting how quickly they’re growing. “They shout about hiring, hiring again and then hiring some more,” says Morrish. “Then the rumours begin…they’re actually struggling to stay afloat. It's fine to fake it ‘til you make it, but only to an extent. Focus on ensuring there’s money in the bank and profits to reinvest and grow sustainably. 90% of businesses fail in the first year, and it’s often because they try to run before they can walk.”The key takeaway here is that startups should invest in growth whilst keeping a razor sharp focus on long term profitability, and enough cash in the bank to deal with the unexpected.  How long should your cash runway be?Operating close to the financial brink is no way to run a business. Companies backed by venture capitalists should give themselves plenty of time to execute their next funding round, bearing in mind investors are unlikely to risk capital on a business that’s a hair’s breadth from going bust.Established businesses and startups alike should give themselves enough buffer to deal with unforeseen circumstances (of which we’ve seen a few in recent years!) without facing a full on crisis. ""Eighteen months is a good runway,” says Pikovsky, “as it allows a six-month time buffer for a company to raise its next round while having twelve months to focus on execution and growth of the business. Equally, if the company decides not to raise money, six months is a good time to put structures in place, reorganise the business and raise debt instead of equity.""
How to improve burn rateIf you want to reduce your net burn rate, you have two options: make more money or spend less of it. You know best how to generate money for your business, so let’s focus on the latter option. The key is to reduce spending without impacting productivity. To achieve this, you need to improve efficiency. A good place to start is your logistical and financial infrastructure.
1) Reduce your COGS (cost of goods sold)Reducing COGS (cost of goods sold) doesn’t have to mean compromising on product quality.
If you import products, make sure your suppliers are cutting you a good deal. As you scale and require more stock, there should be an opportunity to negotiate a better cost per unit. If your suppliers don’t play ball, see if one of their competitors can offer a better price. 
Other ways to reduce COGS include using an economical freight company, ensuring you don’t over-order inventory, and shifting any excess stock during sale periods to avoid overpaying on warehouse costs. 
2) Modernise your financial infrastructure
Many startups throw away money on excess fees because they don’t have the right financial infrastructure in place. High street banks charge extortionate rates for account management, foreign exchange and international payments, and many businesses don’t realise that there is an alternative. 
Airwallex offers free international transfers, market-leading FX rates, and 0% international card fees. You can open multiple foreign and international current accounts in a click and we don’t charge you any account or set up fees. So you can spend less on bank fees and more on your business’ growth. 

3) Get paid on time
Late payments are the bane of many founder’s lives. According to a study by the FSB (Federation of Small Businesses), one in three businesses has experienced late payments in 2022 so far. And one in ten say late payments are threatening the viability of their business.  

To avoid late payments, ensure you invoice on time and continue to remind customers when their payments are overdue. If you sell high-value products or services, it’s a good idea to check your customer’s credit score before you deliver to ensure they can afford to pay their bills. 

You can also ask customers for upfront or part payment before you complete a job or delivery in order to protect yourself against non-payment and ensure you have plenty of cash to cover your overheads.  
4) Choose the right tech stack 
Choosing the right tech stack is a great way to save your business money and improve productivity. If you’re concerned that a tech solution is costing too much, research the alternatives. There could well be a better value option that delivers the same service.  

For example, using the Airwallex payment gateway rather than competitors like PayPal and Stripe will make it cheaper to accept online payments from domestic and international customers.  

Remember, investing in quality tech, such as the right accounting software or payments partner can save you money later down the line.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/buy-with-prime-is-coming-heres-what-it-means-for-d2c-retailers,Buy With Prime is coming. Here’s what it means for D2C retailers,"BlogBuy With Prime is coming. Here’s what it means for D2C retailersShani Ishigaki20 May 2022•7 minutesE-commerceIn this article•What is Buy With Prime?•So, what changed for Amazon?•What does this mean for eCommerce?•Let’s talk about the risksEver wish you could ship your orders as fast as Amazon? Well, that’s what Buy With Prime is promising. Every eCommerce founder knows Shopify’s winning formula plugs a gap Amazon can’t. The platform offers small and medium-sized businesses a better way to create and run their own online shops. All without having to write a line of code.Shopify brought payments and shipping to its loyal and growing customer base with Shop Pay and Shopify Shipping in recent years. And this strategy has worked wonders for the company, generating about $153 billion in sales for the company in 2020. To top it off, Shopify just acquired an end-to-end logistics platform to strengthen its shipping network, including inventory management and returns.End of story? Not quite.Amazon is now planning to take a bite out of Shopify’s market share by launching a new service called Buy With Prime. Naturally, the first market to get access will be the US, but with Amazon’s growing presence in Australia and the UK, there’s no reason to think these markets wouldn’t soon follow.Let’s dig into what Buy With Prime actually is, its pros and cons, and how it could impact your business.
What is Buy With Prime?‘What is Buy With Prime, and why is it breaking news for an eCommerce founder?’ you ask.The new service means merchants will be able to offer Amazon’s speedy delivery options and payment processing to customers via their own website. You can’t argue with the sales-boosting success of Shop Pay and BNPL checkout experiences (and popularity of subscription models).The allure will be even stronger for Prime members who will get access to the same free shipping and returns they can get on Amazon. The service will provide conversion-driving benefits for subscribers, without sacrificing the customer relationships and loyalty brands work hard to build with their own web stores.Initially offered just to Amazon sellers using its fulfilment service, Buy With Prime will eventually be expanded to all merchants.
So, what changed for Amazon?Historically, Amazon wasn’t offering its payment processing and shipping services to retailers unless they were selling via Amazon. Retailers wanting to advertise directly and build brand loyalty with their customers by offering a native experience had to find alternatives.But Amazon soon realised it had already invested substantially in payment processing infrastructure, distribution centres and delivery networks for its marketplace sales. It can also offer these services through a native, Buy With Prime experience without increasing its cost base by a mile. The pricing is yet to be confirmed, but incumbent logistics providers should watch out.
What does this mean for eCommerce?It means Amazon’s ecosystem is getting stronger in 2022. As with Amazon, Buy With Prime will come with its own pros and cons that could make it the right — or wrong — choice for your business. Even if you’re not immediately eligible, it’s important to take stock of what’s coming. It’s going to raise the bar for customer expectations.
FulfilmentThere’s no denying that Amazon dominates the world in terms of its fulfilment processes and technology. With Buy With Prime, merchants will be able to let Amazon pick, pack and ship their orders via its Fullfilment by Amazon (FBA) program. That includes customer service and returns for these products.If you’re unsure about whether Amazon’s FBA service could be the right fit for you, ask yourself the following:Should Amazon hold your inventory and pack your orders?Does it cost you much to do this yourself? Do you have physical stores that already do this for you?How important is fast shipping to your customers and what speed do you offer today?
As with their marketplace, there won’t be any minimum requirements for the number of products you have to send. Amazon also handles all the details and logistics, which could potentially free you up for other things.
DeliveryEvery eCommerce business owner knows that efficient delivery can lay the foundation for longer-term customer lifetime value. So how will Buy With Prime’s shipping stack up? The first thing you need to know is that any customer who’s an existing Prime member will be offered free shipping and returns.That’s right. Amazon will absorb shipping costs for its Prime members, which means more and more consumers will start to expect free (or free-ish) next-day delivery. If you thought expectations were already through the roof, Buy With Prime just raised the stakes. The best way to get an Amazon-like shipping experience? It’s simple, really — ship via Amazon. But that’s not to say it’s the only way to offer free and fast shipping. You could build it into your pricing or shrug it off and keep doing what you’re doing.But if the service appeals to you, you should first consider the likelihood of your customers being Prime members.If the answer is yes, the next question to ask yourself is whether your customers even need or expect free returns. For example, it might not make sense for a grocer to offer the service, but it could help customers get the perfect fit when buying garments from online fashion retailers.Customer experienceMost eCommerce brands wouldn’t have even dreamed of using Amazon’s fulfilment and shipping services if it meant they had to sell via their marketplace. The aggregator has a lot of drawbacks. The first and most obvious reason merchants don’t sell on Amazon is that you can’t control the customer experience or offer personalised unboxing. You also can’t remarket to people who’ve made a previous purchase.But Buy With Prime opens up the option of selling directly to customers, enabling retailers to retain their personalisation, branding and native website experience.Similar to Shop Pay, Buy With Prime will likely offer a simple, one-click payment solution for online shoppers to save their payment information and breeze through checkouts in the future.
Let’s talk about the risksYou’ve likely made up your mind about Buy With Prime already, but just in case, we thought we’d touch on a couple of potential risks to be aware of.Risk number one: The most glaring potential risk of using Buy With Prime’s service is that it would give Amazon access to your sales and customer data. Amazon has flat-out denied such activity, but it has been accused in the past of using seller data to develop and launch its own competing products.Risk number two: Yes, customers will still be making direct purchases from your website and interacting with your brand. But there’s risk in handing over control of every experience beyond Buy With Prime’s payment gateway, including checkout, delivery and unboxing. You should consider the impact on your sales mix and whether it will increase the volume of lower-margin product sales.Risk number three: Because the service will only be eligible for Amazon FBA sellers initially, there’s a risk you’ll need to allocate some of your inventory into Amazon’s warehouse. The current global supply chain issues we’re seeing make it more important than ever to get your inventory management right. Failing to get the right split may force you to set aside money for orders going through another shipping and inventory solution.
Final thoughtsShopify’s Shop Pay currently dominates the eCommerce landscape as a website payment option, so it might not see its growth affected by this new service. But it’s clear both companies are working overtime to win over merchants.Will you be shifting strategy when Buy With Prime lands in your region?If you’d like to learn more about how technology is changing the eCommerce industry, speak to our expert team today.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-benefits-of-virtual-payment-cards,The benefits of virtual debit and credit cards in 2022,"BlogThe benefits of virtual debit and credit cards in 2022Joe Romeo6 May 2022•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What are virtual credit cards?•Reasons why you should use a virtual credit card •What are virtual debit cards?•Reasons why you should use virtual debit cards •Benefits of virtual payments•Try Airwallex virtual cards for your businessVirtual payment cards can revolutionalise the way your businesses manage and make payments, saving teams around the world hours in admin as well as excessive fees. Let's review the core benefits of virtual debit cards and the impact they can have on your business.What are virtual credit cards?Simply put, virtual credit cards are actual finance cards that function entirely online. Randomly generated 16-digit numbers, complete with a card verification number and expiry date, these virtual credit and debit cards act in the same way traditional credit cards do — without the need for a physical card. Accepted anywhere credit cards are used, virtual credit cards are issued by Mastercard, Visa or American Express.But the difference in these cards is how they operate with ease compared to actual credit and debit cards.Most importantly, instead of relying on your bank, you’re in control. You’re able to choose the currency you need, set a spending limit for the card and define the merchant types where the card can be used.Virtual payment cards are streamlining the way payments are made for both suppliers and vendors, and there are a number of compelling benefits for your business.Reasons why you should use a virtual credit card Pros:Virtual credit cards authorise access to your credit quickly and without using a physical card.Some virtual cards even offer point-earning rewards and are a safer alternative when making online purchases. If your card is compromised, virtual credit cards can be voided easily and quickly.Cons:Virtual credit cards can have high fees and interest rates. International transactions can add 3% on average to your purchase. Card-hacking is a real dilemma for both virtual and physical cards, especially with online purchases. Expiration dates can cause trouble with past purchases. If the card is expired, refund processes can be difficult.What are virtual debit cards?Virtual debit cards are comparable to virtual credit cards in most ways except for funding the virtual debit card. A central bank account is required to cover any costs of purchases without the cushion of credit options. After a short online application, you’ll receive a 16-digit number with an expiration date. Reasons why you should use virtual debit cards Pros:Ideally, virtual debit cards are an excellent reduced-risk option to avoid troublesome occurrences such as card loss, theft, hacking or temporary misplacement. You get protected online storage for your virtual debit card details. Keeping up with a physical card can be a challenge.Virtual debit cards can function as short-term or long-term financial solutions.Cons:As with any debit card, your account must have the funds necessary to cover the transaction.Managing your budget demands some attention before making purchases with a virtual debit card. Similar to virtual credit cards, virtual debit cards have an expiration date that can be troublesome when attempting to return purchases. 
Benefits of virtual paymentsYou get increased security in an online environment rife with hackers attempting to compromise your account. In the event of compromised security, virtual payment cards provide reconciliation support with integrity. You can access virtual credit and debit cards instantly.You can create a new account with ease and reliability. Virtual payment cards can empower your business and employees. Virtual cards can be issued to multiple team members who are required to make payments for their business on a daily basis. So instead of hounding your manager or accounts department for access to one single physical card to make a payment (or going through the onerous paperwork to get a corporate card yourself), staff can be issued individual virtual payment cards that are unique to them. 
As a manager, you can set the spending limits on each virtual debit card and virtual credit card, which means you keep a firm hold on your budget when making business payments, and your teams know exactly how much they have available to spend. Eliminating payment bottlenecks means your business can move at a much faster pace by allowing the purchasing of new software and equipment without delays. When executed correctly, purchase requests no longer need to sit in pending for weeks while your staff sits idle awaiting the green light to make the purchase. With their own virtual payment card, they can do so instantly, while you maintain full control.Try Airwallex virtual cards for your businessAirwallex is an Australian fintech that gives everyday businesses access to these virtual cards (and more). Best of all, Airwallex’s multi-currency cards also have zero international transaction fees, so you can use these for all types of payments.

Virtual CFO services•Why hire a virtual CFO? Some of the benefits•4 signs it’s time to hire a vCFO•What should you look for in a virtual CFO?•Ensure your financial success with AirwallexEvery business needs a financial executive once they hit a certain growth point. This strategic partner will help your business navigate periods of accelerated growth and implement systems to sustain it.But chances are you’re not quite ready to commit to a full-time chief financial officer.This is where a virtual CFO, or vCFO, comes in. Keep reading to learn more about what vCFOs are and do, the benefits they can provide to your business, and when it’s time to make the hire.First, what exactly is a virtual CFO?Before we get into why you might be eager to hire a vCFO, let's explore what a virtual CFO in the first place.A virtual CFO offers all of the same expertise and knowledge a traditional CFO can deliver. The difference is that virtual CFOs work remotely and typically as a contractor on a part-time or ad-hoc basis.Hiring a virtual CFOs is a smart move for small and medium-sized businesses that need strategic financial advice and planning, but can’t afford to hire a full-time in-house CFO. Before remote work became more mainstream and vCFOs became easy to find, these businesses often went without the right advice. Now, they can easily contract vCFOs for however much time and support they need.Meanwhile, virtual CFOs are still able to maintain a full work schedule by working with multiple clients at a time. It’s a win-win.What does a virtual CFO do? Virtual CFO servicesVirtual CFO services vary widely depending on the size and needs of an organisation. However, vCFOs typically provide at least the following general services:Reporting: Ensuring accurate and on-time reporting relating to a business’ cash flow, condition and performanceCompliance: Maintaining compliance with all local, state, and federal taxes, laws and regulationsFinancial strategy: Providing insights to help management develop business strategiesControls: Implementing and monitoring controls for a business’ performance and internal operationsHowever, vCFO responsibilities have been increasing fast over recent years. For example, a 2018 McKinsey Global Survey revealed that CFOs are increasingly being asked to take on board engagement and digitisation, such as advanced analytics, data visualisation, cloud computing and business process automation. With CFO expectations changing, it’s best not to assume your vCFO candidates will or will not provide a specific service. Be sure to ask what a vCFO is capable of providing when vetting candidates to ensure they can meet all your needs.Why hire a virtual CFO? Some of the benefitsAs well as carrying out some of the financial responsibilities that business owners themselves don’t have the time or skill sets for, vCFOs provide invaluable benefits that will shape future success. For example, you can expect: Accountability: After helping you set goals and strategy, vCFOs can help you stick to them. Expect regular check-ins to ensure you’re on track to meet milestones. Often, this kind of accountability is the motivation businesses need to follow through on their strategies.Risk management: Risk is an inevitable part of doing business, and managing it well can be the difference between success and failure. This is where vCFOs add enormous value. Before making any significant change or decision, such as hiring or purchasing new equipment, your vCFO can walk you through the numbers to assess the associated risks.Reduced costs: We’ve already discussed how virtual CFOs can save businesses big by enabling them to forego the full-time salary associated with traditional CFOs. But vCFOs can reduce costs even further by identifying areas of unnecessary spending and reducing waste.Increased profitability: Increasing profitability is the primary goal for any vCFO — and any business. To this end, your vCFO will help improve your business plan and strategy, internal processes, and cash flow. Journey navigation: A vCFO can help you navigate the many and never-ending decisions associated with running a business, such as:Setting up structuresHow to manage growthCash flow optimisationPricingStock managementRequesting payment from debtorsPreparing for (or responding to) unexpected incidentsExit planning4 signs it’s time to hire a vCFOYou probably realise by this point that a vCFO will be a necessary upgrade at some point in your business’ growth trajectory. But it’s also essential to make this hire preventively to anticipate future needs, and not retroactively to clean up financial messes.So how can you tell it’s time to take the next step and contract a vCFO?Fortunately, it’s a fairly easy decision to make. If any of the following is true for your business, it’s definitely time to put up a listing: 
You’re struggling to manage your finances. Founding or running a business doesn’t necessarily mean that finances are your strong suit. If the numbers are getting away from you as you manage the other areas of your business, it’s time to call in some help before things spiral out of control.You’re experiencing rapid growth. Whether or not you have a good grasp on your finances now, if your business is growing rapidly, you’re going to need a vCFO to help you manage the decisions that will inevitably come with that growth. Many businesses fail because they grow too fast and can’t keep up — don’t let that be you.You have over $1 million in annual revenue. Financial management, reporting and planning become significantly more complex once income reaches seven digits. Knowing this will help you plan to bring a vCFO on board when you’re nearing that milestone.You plan on selling your business in the near future. Contrary to what you might expect, preparing to sell your business isn’t the time to loosen the financial reins. Preparing to sell requires meticulous reporting, careful planning and a complete shift in your current strategy. A vCFO can help you manage these changes and get your business looking as financially healthy as possible to attract a high bid.What should you look for in a virtual CFO?It goes without saying that hiring the right vCFO will make all the difference. When vetting candidates, be sure to look for the following:Certifications and qualifications: Your vCFO should have degrees and experience in accounting or finance. Ask for references from their past clients to corroborate their past work and learn more about their performance.Expertise in your industry: Any CFO can provide general financial knowledge, but the best vCFO for your business will have expertise in your specific niche.Safeguards to protect your data: vCFOs should have client protections and systems in place to protect your data and prevent miscommunication and fraud.Efficient and transparent communication: The most qualified vCFO out there won’t serve your business well if they don’t communicate promptly and transparently. Ensure that you’re on the same page in terms of communication to make the most of your vCFO’s knowledge and experience.Ensure your financial success with AirwallexYou know what else is a smart business move?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-business-mentor-11-powerful-qualities,What to look for in a business mentor: 11 powerful qualities,"BlogWhat to look for in a business mentor: 11 powerful qualitiesShani Ishigaki6 April 2022•6 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What is a mentor?•How do I find a business mentor?•11 powerful qualities to look for in a business mentor•The next step for your businessThere it is, glaring back at you at the end of each jam-packed day from the bottom of your to-do list: find a mentor. But how do you know what to look for in a business mentor? In this article, we’ll explain the 11 key qualities that separate an average mentor from an outstanding one.Finding a business mentor who’s a good fit can seem daunting at first, but it’s certainly worthwhile. The right advice can shift your business forward months or even years.What is a mentor?A mentor is someone who provides guidance and advice for your business. A mentor usually advises the business owners, CEO, founder or co-founders.Traditionally a mentor is unpaid and meets with the mentee (that’s you) regularly over the long term. That might be every two weeks or once a month, depending on their availability and the time sensitivity of what they’re advising you on.Nowadays, there are many websites where you can hire a mentor by the minute to get specific answers to questions you may have on your mind. You might have several mentors — one mentor for marketing or product advice, and another for raising capital or general business growth management. Or, if you’re part of an incubator, you might have access to a whole pool of mentors for a period of time.A mentor isn’t a consultant. A mentor’s remit is to listen, ask questions, and offer suggestions to help you learn to make good business decisions. A consultant on the other hand, is always paid, takes a brief, and provides solutions.How do I find a business mentor?And now for the mentor selection. Spending half an hour preparing for selecting a mentor will save you (and potential mentors) time in the long run. It will bring you closer to knowing what to look for in a mentor for your business. Consider these three things:
What does your business need guidance on most right now? Prioritise the subjects.Which subjects do you already have expertise, mentorship, advisors or consultants supporting you with? Place names next to each of the subjects.Now you’ve got the subjects and existing support mapped out, take a look at the highest priority subject. Do you have enough support? If not, that might be the subject you’re looking for a mentor with expertise in. Work your way through the subjects until you have a clear understanding of the areas you need most guidance on.
One more step for preparation before choosing a mentor: consider whether you’re ready to listen to the advice of a mentor with an open mind. Think about how you’ll ask questions and receive feedback so that you can get the most out of being mentored.Being mentored is different to pitching, different to hiring, and different to briefing a consultant. You need to find someone you can trust and learn from. Now we’ll take a look at the qualities to look for when finding a business mentor.11 powerful qualities to look for in a business mentorExperienceIdeally, your mentor will have done something similar to what you’d like to achieve. Look for someone who’s six months to five years ahead of you on their journey. They will have made their way through a similar landscape to the one you’ll need to navigate and have the right skill set to share. KnowledgeThink about the subjects you need help with. Do you need to find product-market fit, master cash flow or promote and market your existing product to a broader audience? Are you entering a specific vertical or geographic market? Look for a mentor who understands the areas you need help in. Keep in mind that a product-focused founder may not have a deep knowledge of marketing and vice versa. Not a competitorHaving a competitor as a mentor is rarely conducive to building the trust that’s required. But that doesn’t mean you can’t select a mentor that’s coaching businesses in competition with yours. This can be advantageous as they’ll have deep knowledge of the market. Just make sure no proprietary information is shared outside the mentor-mentee relationship.Shared valuesA mentor and mentee don’t need to agree on everything. In fact, healthy discussion will be far more beneficial than an echo chamber. For good mentor relationships, it’s helpful to find some alignment on shared values. That might look like agreement on employee benefits, work-life balance and competitive behaviour. If you lean towards co-op and they believe you should hold onto as much business ownership as you can, it may be hard to find common ground.Personal connectionThe mentor-mentee relationship demands significant vulnerability to work. You may also be asking them to be a sounding board for esoteric ideas. It’s beneficial to find someone who ‘gets you’.Mutual respectHaving respect for one another goes a long way in ensuring debate is respectful. You’ll be more open to ideas you hadn’t thought of, or which challenge your perspective. A respectful mentor separates their ego from the performance of you and your business and communicates directly and respectfully.Active listenerIdeally, your mentor will be doing most of the talking, because when you’re talking, you’re not learning. That said, your mentor will need to be able to hear what you’re trying to achieve, understand any challenges and tease out any underlying issues and opportunities. Will teach you to fishIt sounds counterintuitive but great mentors don’t offer solutions. They ask good questions, and make suggestions. They help you to discover the information (and sometimes courage) you need to make successful decisions.AvailableSimple. The best mentor in the world is no good if you can’t make your schedules match up at least once a month. HonestA mentor’s job includes sharing their perspective from the outside looking in. This is one of the most valuable and important parts of the mentor-mentee relationship. When you’re working on and in the business, it’s easy to miss risks and opportunities. You want a mentor who will tell you straight. CurrentThat’s not to say the opportunity to work with an entrepreneur who took the market by storm in the 90s couldn’t be a great opportunity. Consider what you need to learn most about. Is the mentor’s knowledge still relevant? If it’s supply chains you’re after and the players, technology and channels haven’t changed much, perhaps. But if you’re needing to learn how to launch in a market where eCommerce has completely changed since the mentor’s experience, you might need to find a more appropriate problem to soundboard with them, or keep looking. Connections with peopleIt’s not essential, and introductions should never be assumed. But it sure does help if your mentor has good connections with people. They’ll be having conversations with their peers and their knowledge will be up to date. Plus, they just might introduce you to your next employee, mentor, co-founder, CEO or investor. Be sure to respect their professional relationships. Your behaviour can reflect on your mentor.The next step for your businessAt Airwallex, we’ve been lucky to have some great mentors who have helped propel our business forward.

Their team connects onshore businesses with the very best software engineers, creatives, digital marketing specialists and eCommerce customer support representatives.
Understanding the cost of hiring and retaining a high-performing outsourced team Filta knows that competition in the outsourcing market is tight, particularly when attracting the best talent. But they don’t just help businesses hire the right people — they help businesses retain those star performers and build team loyalty.When COVID-19 forced teams to become more distributed, Filta continued to achieve these outcomes, supplying every employee with the tools and support they needed for a work-from-home setup. From laptops and internet allowances to continuing team recognition and celebrations such as virtual lunches, birthdays and anniversaries, their efforts helped Filta grow their team against all odds.However, this rapid expansion meant that the cost of sending money overseas to pay all their necessary expenses was also rising quickly. But with overseas bank transfers taking longer than a week, supporting their staff and clients grew ever more challenging. They felt the pinch of hefty fees for every transaction.
How a chance meeting created a valuable relationshipFilta co-founders Nerissa and Efren Chaux weren’t actually looking for a new international payments partner when they stumbled upon Airwallex. It was a chance meeting through the Shopify community where they first learned about our services.Right away, Nerissa and Efren could see the value that Airwallex would deliver to their rapidly growing business. The benefits were obvious with an excellent exchange rate, effortless international transfers, and the ability to charge clients in local currencies.
Streamlined payments mean better businessAirwallex’s virtual payment cards sealed the deal. With immediate creation and no set-up costs, they reduced their administration load significantly while empowering their staff to make purchases without waiting for petty cash or reimbursements.“Virtual cards have removed a large amount of administrative time and risk when paying for goods and services in other markets. Features such as employee cards and card limits allow us to automate payments such as subscriptions and manage the risk of purchasing goods with the click of a couple of buttons,” says Filta co-founder and CEO Efren Chaux. “This also removes friction from our internal process and creates greater value for our clients.”
Better business means a brighter futureAs a people-solution company, working with great people and partners is mission-critical.Partnering with Airwallex helped them simplify their overseas transfers and streamline client payments. Filta’s teams drastically reduced their teams’ admin hours by deploying virtual cards. It also eliminated the typical risks of paying for goods and services in other markets.“Airwallex’s rate is as good as anyone else in the market, so we’re definitely saving money,” says Efren. “However, my saving metric is more than just financial. Thanks to the speed in which I can transfer money to local staff in the Philippines along with the virtual cards, we save a lot of time and can create a point of difference in our market by servicing client needs a lot quicker.”The time savings meant they could focus more on high-value tasks that helped deliver greater value to their clients. What’s more, they’ve reinvested the money they’ve saved by reducing unnecessary fees in activities that support their teams’ wellbeing and career development.Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs

Jee Lee, you joined us from a completely different industry. What prompted the career switch and what brought you here?Like many other fresh graduates, I started off my career as a Consultant at one of the big four consulting giants. It was a stable job, but over time I found myself yearning for a role where I would be able to better witness first-hand the impact of my day-to-day contributions. Upon reflection of what I wanted out of my career, I figured it was time for me to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, and that brought me to Airwallex. Two years in, I’m glad I made the decision to take the career leap. There has been a steep learning curve, but it has also pushed me to expand my horizons and grow beyond what I ever thought was imaginable.After close to 2 years with Airwallex, what continues to excite you about the company?I’m always excited by the endless growth possibilities at Airwallex, especially in my role where I’m constantly collaborating with numerous team members across the globe and building new global partnerships. I believe Airwallex is a company that continues to pursue innovation and encourages everyone to take on new challenges. I’m incredibly proud to be a part of this journey.What does a typical day in your financial partnerships role look like?The financial partners (that our team works with) form an integral foundation for Airwallex’s suite of products. It’s vital for me and my team to build and maintain deep relationships with our financial partners every day, while also working cross-functionally with internal stakeholders to achieve Airwallex’s strategic goals. 
Being in a role that comes with a lot of different moving pieces keeps things interesting and ensures no two days are the same – this is one thing I really enjoyed about my job!Tell us about some of your proudest moments at Airwallex.The most rewarding aspect of my job is being able to see the decisions I make actually get implemented, and in turn, make a tangible impact on our business. One milestone that really stands out was being able to witness our debut in Singapore. Late last year, we clinched the Major Payment Institution license from MAS which was a massive win for the organisation. Being able to secure such an important license has been extremely empowering and meaningful, not just for the Singapore team, but also for our global colleagues who worked very hard for it.What do you enjoy most about working with the Singapore team?Everyone is fun and enjoys collaborating! Since joining, I have seen the team double (or even close to triple) in headcount and I’m constantly amazed by how every new joiner is so driven and talented – yet very down-to-earth. We have employees spanning across numerous departments, but the lines of communication are always kept open so there is never a barrier in engaging with one another.I also love the autonomy and trust my manager has placed on me to spearhead projects and initiatives – it’s really rewarding to go out and try to solve problems while owning the success of your own contributions.Outside of Airwallex, what keeps you busy?Beyond the work I do at Airwallex, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends – this has been a delightful upside of the pandemic. The phrase “master of none” really resonates with me as I like to try a bit of everything just to keep myself active and curious, but nothing beats being able to travel and experience different countries and cultures, which I can’t wait to do now that borders have opened up again!Looking to take the next step in your career?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-your-online-business-can-accept-apple-pay,How your online business can accept Apple Pay,"BlogHow your online business can accept Apple PayShani Ishigaki25 March 2022•5 minutesFinanceBusiness tipsE-commerceIn this article•What is Apple Pay?•How does Apple Pay work?•Why should my business accept Apple Pay?•How to accept Apple Pay in an online business•Is Apple Pay free for businesses?•Airwallex makes accepting Apple Pay easyAs global online sales continue to grow, so do customer expectations. Digital wallets, like Apple Pay™ are becoming more popular, more secure — and without all the friction, more necessary for eCommerce success. Learn what Apple Pay is, how it works, and why and how to start accepting it.What is Apple Pay?Apple Pay is a mobile payment system from Apple. You can set it up on your preferred Apple devices (iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or MacBook) using your credit card or banking information. You can then use your devices to purchase items online without ever having to take out your debit or credit card. Just select the option for Apple Pay when choosing a payment method.Apple Pay also works for making in-app purchases, paying for transit fare (where it’s accepted), and sending and receiving payments to and from other Apple Pay users.How does Apple Pay work?The primary technology behind online Apple Pay payments is called tokenisation.Tokenisation protects users’ banking details from identity theft and fraud. It replaces the consumer’s credit card number with “tokens,” or randomly generated numbers.Because the token, and not the actual account number, is stored in Apple Pay and transmitted during transactions, there’s no risk of stolen financial information.Why should my business accept Apple Pay?Accepting Apple Pay provides numerous benefits to eCommerce businesses.Enhanced securityMost importantly, payments made through Apple Pay are very secure. Two layers of protection serve to protect consumers’ information:Tokenisation: As we explained above, the card data stored in and transmitted by Apple Pay is tokenised (or replaced with randomly generated numbers), protecting it from fraud. While this is an obvious benefit for consumers, many businesses also appreciate that they don’t have to handle sensitive data.Authentication: Users must scan their fingers using Touch ID to authenticate Apple Pay transactions through their Apple device. This means that even if someone’s device is stolen, the thief won’t be able to access their Apple Pay.Frictionless paymentApple Pay is also a frictionless payment method. If you’re struggling with conversions, digital wallets like Apple Pay can help customers breeze through the checkout experience.For example, customers don’t need to go through the hassle of entering card details or billing and shipping addresses. For shoppers who are in a hurry, this can be the difference between making the sale or not. After all, 39% of US cart abandonments are due to lengthy or complicated checkout forms.Apple Pay users also get to skip the hassle of 3 Domain Server (3DS) authentication, which provides added security at the cost of extra steps at checkout. The long-winded steps required by 3DS have been shown to decrease conversions for eCommerce merchants, with reports indicating that conversions decreased between 22% to 50%.Fortunately, Apple Pay enables consumers to skip these steps without jeopardising their security.Increased conversionsIt comes as no surprise that the above benefits translate to increased conversions. But just how much Apple Pay can affect conversions is worthy of attention: Merchants using Apple Pay have seen conversion rate increases of up to 250%.That’s in addition to reducing the time it takes to complete checkout by up to 58%.Apple Pay is a must for eCommerce merchants looking for ways to help hesitant shoppers seal the deal.How to accept Apple Pay in an online businessSetting up Apple Pay for in-person purchases requires a couple of extra steps, such as getting an NFC-enabled payment terminal. However, accepting Apple Pay for eCommerce is quite simple:Choose an Apple Pay-friendly payment processor. The websites of the payment processors you’re considering should make it clear whether they accept Apple Pay.Set up your Apple Pay payment infrastructure. This may involve adding a “Buy With Apple Pay” button to your website’s checkout page or following simple steps to activate Apple Pay. Check with your specific eCommerce platform for instructions.Connect Apple Pay to your website. Your website should have instructions available on how to activate Apple Pay in your online payment gateway.And that’s it!Is Apple Pay free for businesses?Apple does not charge merchants any fees for using Apple Pay either in person or online. So, you can start increasing conversions and providing a better, more secure checkout experience at no additional cost.Airwallex makes accepting Apple Pay easyAccepting Apple Pay as an online business isn’t difficult. However, using Airwallex as your payment processor makes it even easier.Airwallex enables merchants to register themselves for Apple Pay in three easy steps via our web app. (Our documentation even includes a step-by-step video with foolproof instructions.) We then handle most of the integration for you behind the scenes, requiring little to no effort from you and your business. Once Apple Pay is set up, your customers can start using it immediately for standard purchases with Visa and Mastercard. Meanwhile, you’ll also be reaping the other benefits of Airwallex’s Online Payments, such as:Payment settling in multiple currencies Fraud protection using our 3DS fraud engineFlexible integration methodsNo monthly fees or hidden costsLearn more by reading our Apple Pay documentation, or sign up to start offering Apple Pay in your online store no time.Related article: A Guide to Multi-currency Payment GatewaysBack to blogShareShani IshigakiContent Marketing ManagerWriter, content strategist and storyteller.

Any plans you have can only be achieved if they're backed by steady investment. So, if you have a clearly articulated elevator pitch for your product or service, you might be asking, ""is debt or equity financing the better choice for my startup?""There's more than one way to fund a new business venture and maximise its growth potential. Bringing in funding will at some point be necessary, whether it's to get your business off the ground, expand on what you're already doing or create an emergency capital stream. There are two key types of financing: equity and debt. And both options have their pros and cons. Consider whether you want things like cash flow flexibility or complete control over your business to decide which avenue is right for your startup.Let's look at how to decide on your startup funding game plan. But first: let's explore the key differences between debt and equity financing.
What is debt financing?Debt financing offers your business a cash injection without having to give up any equity in your startup. This method involves borrowing money from others and paying it back in instalments over a fixed period at a predetermined rate. How quickly you'll need to pay back your debt will depend on where you've borrowed it from. 
What is equity financing?Equity finance is the most well-known form of startup funding and involves exchanging capital for ownership rights in your business. Sources of equity financing often come from close business partnerships but can also be sourced from:VC funds from venture capital firmsAngel investorsCrowdfunding platformsThe public in the form of an IPO (initial public offering)With equity financing, there are no fixed repayments to be made. Instead, your equity investors will receive a percentage of your company's profits, depending on how much stock they were given as part of the initial arrangement. How do startups get funding?Here are some ways your startup can obtain funding so you can hit the ground running. These are examples of both debt and equity financing types. 
Angel investmentThe phrase 'angel investors' can be pretty apt for startups, as their investment can be a miracle for small businesses that are just getting going. Angel investors typically invest in startups or companies in their early stages in exchange for an equity ownership interest. The typical angel investment is USD 25,000 – 100,000 per company; however, this depends on the market opportunity your startup addresses and evidence of traction. Uber, WhatsApp and Facebook were all supported in their early stages by angel investors. You can find Angel investors through:Angel syndicates (platforms to access a network of angels interested in investing into a pool of funds on a deal-by-deal basis)Startup accelerators and incubatorsNetworking with other entrepreneursSpeaking with lawyers and accountantsSpecific angel investor networksCrowdfunding sites like IndieGogo and Kickstarter
CrowdfundingCrowdfunding involves raising capital through multiple investors, often through websites that are specifically designed to secure crowdfunding opportunities. Setting up a crowdfunding campaign is pretty simple, and people will usually donate to your campaign in exchange for a reward. For example, you may offer one of your products or services in exchange for a donation or some form of equity or profit share in your business. To run a successful crowdfunding campaign, you'll need to create an engaging story about your company, so you can really show potential donors what your business is about and the mission you're trying to fulfil.Some of the most popular crowdfunding sites include:KickstarterIndiegogoCrowd SupplyCrowdfunderSeedInvestCrowdcubeFundlyGoFundMeiFundWomenVentureCrowdBirchalVenture Capital (VC funds)
Although not easy to secure, VC funding can provide much more than just capital. Firms can also provide strategic business assistance, new employees, and networking opportunities with customers and partners. VC firms usually want to invest in startups that are pursuing big ideas and a high-growth mindset and those that have already shown some promising success, whether through a great product prototype or early customer support for the startup's offering.Traditionally, VC investments have been a local activity, but new opportunities in emerging markets and the rise of global payments are seeing capital flow across borders.It's important to remember that VC firms get inundated with daily investment requests, so work hard on your elevator pitch beforehand and make sure you have a truly engaging presentation deck to work from. Even better, secure an introduction to a venture capitalist through a friend, family member or business associate. 
Small business credit cardsSome traditional banks offer credit cards specifically catering to the small business market, including perks like cash back rewards, airline points or other small rewards. Small business credit cards offer a good level of flexibility for your startup's funding needs. However, interest on unpaid balances can often be relatively high, ranging from 5% to even 19.9%.It's important to take into account that small business credit cards will often need to be linked to the owner's personal accounts, meaning that any late payments will affect your personal credit score.If you're confident you'll be able to make your repayments on time and you find an issuer with a reasonable interest rate, a small business credit card can be a good option for flexible startup funding needs.
What are the pros and cons of debt financing?Pros of debt financingNo loss of control or ownership. With debt financing, you get to retain absolute control of your business (not to mention keep all the profits). You get to make the decisions and decide which directions your business goes in in the future. You won't be in debt forever. You can repay and borrow as much as you need to at any time, and you only pay the interest you need to. Once you've paid back your debts, your liability is over.Tax deductions. An often overlooked pro of debt financing is creating more tax deductions down the track. This may not have a significant impact in the early stages of your business, but it can have a massive difference in net profits as your business grows and brings in higher revenue. 
Cons of debt financingNon-flexible repayments. The main downside of debt financing is that the money needs to be paid back no matter how well or poorly your business is performing. This revenue pressure can be a major downfall for startups if cash flow isn't adequately managed. High-interest rates for startups. Investing in startups is risky for traditional banks, given the high failure rate of businesses. So, to cover up or compensate for losses, debt funding means investors can lend funds at higher interest rates. 
What are the pros and cons of equity financing?Pros of equity financingLarger cash injections. As we mentioned earlier, traditional banks are notoriously reluctant to loan what they deem to be large amounts of money to small businesses. Your business' growth could be capped depending on how reliable your access to healthy cash flow is without equity capital startup funding.Cash flow flexibility. Another benefit of equity financing is that you don't have any debt to pay if you aren't profitable. This 'stress less' approach can be beneficial to businesses, as founders feel empowered to make intelligent decisions that aren't based on the crushing fear of not making debt repayments.  Mentorship and networking opportunities. Obtaining your startup funding through VC funds can open your business to a wide variety of investors who are experienced, invested or simply just interested in your industry. There's much to learn from others in the early days, so connecting with other founders can be invaluable. Cons of equity financingGiving up total business autonomy. Having multiple rounds to secure VC funds will hold your business in good stead, but it also takes away the indepence of the founder. Having financial partners means giving up a certain percentage of control, which can impact every single area of your business. You'll have to split the profits. Equity financing means that not every dollar your startup makes will go back into the business. Unfortunately, your investors may be entitled to your positive returns before you even receive a penny.

You don’t need to worry about sharing these details. Your sort code and account number can be used to deposit money into your account and set up a direct debit, but they can't be used to fraudulently take money out of it.People you might need to share your account number and sort code with include: your employer, your clients, organisations using the Direct Debit Scheme, friends and family who wish to transfer you money.  Never give out your PIN, card number, card expiry date or CVV unless paying for something securely online. These details can be used by fraudsters to access the funds in your account.  What is an account number?An account number is specific to your particular account. If you have several accounts, for example a savings account and a current account, they will have different numbers, even if you hold them with the same bank.UK account numbers are eight digits long. There are some that are seven digits, but a zero is added to the front of the number to standardise the length.What is a sort code?The sort code indicates the bank and the branch where you opened the account. It’s made up of six digits, grouped in pairs. You don’t need to worry about spacing the numbers out when entering them online.The first digits describe the bank or provider you have the account with, and the later digits refer to the branch. Some banks are online-only and don’t have brick-and-mortar branches. For these banks, every customer is given the same sort code. Six-digit sort codes in the UK date back to 1957, and were a result of the industry becoming more automated. Are sort codes and account numbers the same in the Republic of Ireland?Sort codes are no longer used in the Republic of Ireland. Instead, all information is held within the account number.As a part of the Eurozone, transactions in Ireland are processed using an IBAN, or International Bank Account Number.An IBAN has 34 characters: both numbers and letters. It identifies the bank, the specific account, and the geographical location of the branch, as well as potential routing information.Where do I find my sort code and account number?If you have a bank debit or credit card, you can typically find the sort code and account number printed on it, along with your name. Be careful not to confuse either your account number or sort code with the 16-digit number that’s also printed on the card. This number is used to authorise online payments, along with the card expiry date and CVV. You should never give this number out unless you are making a secure payment. Remember, the account number is eight digits long and the sort code is six digits, grouped into pairs.Another place you can find your account number and sort code is on bank statements. If you have a banking app or online log-in, this information should also be displayed along with other details about your account. Can sort codes and account numbers be used for international transfers?Sort codes and account numbers are used for domestic transfers within the UK. You may need to share your IBAN, or additional details, to receive money from abroad.How are sort codes and account numbers used for direct debits?Organisations using the Direct Debit Scheme can use your account number, sort code and address to set up a direct debit from your account. These organisations include charities, utilities providers, and other subscription-based businesses. Organisations within the Direct Debit Scheme are carefully vetted, and any money taken by direct debit in error is protected under the Direct Debit Guarantee. For this reason, it is safe to share your account number and sort code with these organisations. Save money and time with AirwallexAirwallex is a global business account designed for companies that operate across borders. We make it easier and cheaper to accept international payments by allowing you to open 11+ foreign currency accounts in a tap, with no monthly account fees.  Open a British Pound account with Airwallex from anywhere in the world and you will be given an account number and sort code.

While you may not have heard of Davie Group, you would certainly know one of their multiple brands, like The Oodie or Pupnaps. Every ten seconds Davie Group sells a product across the globe, with lines in clothing, health and wellness, beauty and pet care. With plans in the pipeline for an IPO, its ambitions are bigger than ever. Next year, the group has a projected revenue of almost $250 million. After only three years of operation, the growth for Davie Group is exponential, recording record-breaking sales month-on-month.Standing out from the crowd: Davie Group's commitment to community and qualityIn essence, the story for Davie Group is relatively simple. The now 26-year-old David Fogarty started the business by identifying high-quality products (such as The Oodie and the Calming Blanket), a gap in the market, and a belief that people would love and enjoy these products.The heart of Davie Group, and the key to its success, is its community and its commitment to quality. The number of return customers is proof of this formula.""We have a product that people actually love. It's a quality product that enables us to stand out from the rest of the competition,"" says Darren Chandler, Head of Finance at Davie Group.Most importantly, people are telling their friends to try these products. The loyal customer base is a crucial differentiator for the eCommerce business that vows never to drop-ship to maintain its customer connection.""What we essentially build is a community… We want people to enjoy the product, to come back, and to tell their friends and family,"" says Darren.
Skills and systems: advice for rising eCommerce starsSince leaving corporate life, Darren Chandler has worked at Davie Group as the Head of Finance and has not looked back. He appreciates that David Fogarty's (Founder and CEO) work philosophy is to get in and get it done.Reflecting on some of the challenges that come with burgeoning popularity, Darren recalls that the Davie Group ran into stock issues because they could not keep up with the global demand. For most of the last year, brands like The Oodie were on presale, which wasn't ideal.""If our customers want to purchase from the Davie Group, we want to get it to them quickly… Davie has never drop-shipped a product. The time from customer order to customer receiving under the drop-ship model is not something we would like our brand known for,"" says Darren.In the last quarter of the calendar year 2020, Davie Group ran into stock constraints due to its explosive growth across the globe. This resulted in concerns that customers would not receive their orders in time for the Christmas and holiday periods.“What did we do to circumvent this issue? We air-freighted our goods to their destination countries. While this adds significant cost to our COGS we know that without happy and satisfied customers, it becomes near impossible to build that community around the brand,” says Darren.While this scenario was an almost unavoidable pain point for a growing business, Darren is sure that Davie Group is getting the right people in the right place. As the supply chain and operations are en route to meet demand, Davie Group is now focusing on developing the supporting business infrastructure.Darren is adamant that recruiting well is the first step to establishing any supporting infrastructure. ""It is always people first. You have to evaluate what your skills are, where the gaps are and try to recruit the right people."" Yet, the speed of recruitment may be a bottleneck for Davie Group. The finance and IT departments alone are looking to grow their headcount by 500 per cent in the next year.Streamlining financial processes with AirwallexThe second step is to streamline the processes and systems. Airwallex has been an essential and streamlined solution to enable the finance functions.""Through Airwallex, its platform brings it all together and makes holding multiple currencies, converting currencies and making global payments a whole lot simpler.""As an eCommerce consolidation business, each brand at Davie Group was managed separately with its own banking systems and platforms. Now, Davie Group is looking to streamline the entire system and open Airwallex accounts as required. For a business operating 12 global brands (and counting), the ability for Airwallex to hold multiple currencies in a single, global account is invaluable.Davie Group also uses Airwallex cards for ""anything and everything"", with the ability to access the multiple currencies that Davie Group holds. The virtual and physical cards ring-fence costs for different departments or online advertising campaigns. ""It's a one-stop-shop solution for all your funding requirements and your banking needs."" The future remains bright for Davie Group. Its growth strategy centres on three main pillars. Grow existing brands, launch new brands, and finally, acquire new brands. The US is a priority market; Singapore is its international launch pad. Only now is Davie Group starting to get the recognition that it deserves, and with a possible IPO on the horizon, Davie Group is also looking to venture out into the public eye, and they'll be one to watch.Ready to scale your business with our business account?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-pain-free-guide-to-business-expense-management,The pain-free guide to managing business expenses,"BlogThe pain-free guide to managing business expensesShani Ishigaki23 February 2022•7 minutesBusiness tipsFinanceNo business, regardless of industry or products and services offered, can get away from the not-so-thrilling task of expense management. Submitting and reviewing receipts for validation, while mundane, is absolutely essential to the success of every business.But what many businesses don’t realise is that expense management doesn’t have to be as hard — or even as tedious — as it was in the past. Whether your business is brand-new and needs to implement expense management processes for the first time, or simply needs to improve current operations, our pain-free guide to expense management is for you. The importance of proper business expense managementFinances are always a crucial element of making strategic business decisions. But getting a clear picture of your money going in and out of your business is easier said than done. It takes the average small business over a week to approve a claim for reimbursement.Proper business travel and expense management makes all the difference.When handled effectively, business expense management can increase:Visibility: Established processes for tracking expenses and reporting enable your business to gain insights quickly and at a highly granular level. Whenever management teams need information on expenditures, it will be readily available — no scrambling to go through reports necessary. This represents an invaluable resource that will come to drive your business strategy.Control: Expenses are often submitted outside of policy or with incorrect or missing information. In fact, a 2015 survey from the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation and HRS found that an average of 19% of submitted expense reports have errors. Even when unintentional and seemingly minor, these issues can pose problems when it comes to meeting compliance requirements and avoiding fraud. Implementing expense management tools that automatically check for such issues can save your finance team hours of admin performing manual checks, preventing human error and maintaining compliance.Productivity: According to the same GBTA Foundation and HRS survey mentioned above, the average expense report takes 20 minutes to complete, which costs $58 in manpower. And the reports that end up having errors take an additional 18 minutes and $52 to correct. An expense management tool that automates these processes can prevent the human error that leads to corrections, save money and free up employees to carry out their actual work.How to manage business expenses: 6 tipsThese six simple steps will get your business travel and expense management system up and running in no time.Recruit your finance teamIn the early days, a lot of founders or CEOs find themselves solely responsible for their business’ expense management. But a dedicated finance team will likely be necessary as soon as a business starts to grow.Not only will you have more time to focus on growing your business, you can feel confident that those handling your finances are qualified to do so.This team will be responsible for managing income, expenditures, forecasting, and budgeting. From running granular daily operations to providing insights that will drive big decisions, your finance team will be crucial to your business’ long-term success.Outline processes for submitting and validating expensesMake it as easy as possible to manage your expenses by outlining processes for submitting and validating them. Simply turning over receipts to a dedicated person or place may work for small teams. But this solution quickly becomes a mess of paperwork as teams grow. This is when you’ll want to start thinking about automating the process. To simplify even further, consider creating a workflow that eliminates paperwork rather than creating more.Keep the following in mind when outlining your processes:Card issuance: Who should be assigned a corporate card, and what is the process for issuing cards? Will you use physical cards or virtual cards?Budget allocation: Will you assign specific budgets to different teams? Acceptable expense types and thresholds: What kind of expenses will be validated, and is there a maximum amount for each expense type that employees can spend? For example, businesses typically set a per diem amount for meals on business trips.Expense documentation: What paperwork do employees need to submit in order to validate their expenses? Just a receipt, or something more?
Having simple processes in place for real-time expense validation gives you up-to-date insight into current spending — no more waiting until the month’s end to know where you’re at.Use secure payment methodsAnyone who has worked in a startup or small business has likely had to ask for the company credit card to make a purchase. But sharing a single card becomes increasingly difficult as teams grow and become more remote — not to mention the likelihood of cards getting lost.Nowadays there are many more modern options, specifically designed to support remote teams, prevent loss, and reduce misuse.For example, virtual cards allow you to instantly create new cards for immediate use — regardless of where you and your team members are located. Assign virtual cards to specific team members with specific one-time or monthly budgets and get instant insight into purchases as they happen.Some virtual cards, like our multi-currency cards, even facilitate global purchases. We don't charge you any international transaction fees and offer better foreign exchange (FX) rates than the banks. This is especially important if you have employees or vendors overseas, regularly travel abroad for business or source foreign products or services.Establish spending guidelinesYou may have already considered spending guidelines when outlining your processes for submitting expenses, but they’re important enough to warrant their own step.As explained above, outline which types of expenses will be reimbursed or approved and include a spending cap for each expense type. Types of expenses that may apply to your business include:Client meetingsEventsEntertainmentBusiness travel airfareGround transportation (gas, rental cars, bus/train tickets, etc.)ConferencesMealsLodging ParkingOffice suppliesEquipment Tools and solutions VendorsBe as specific as possible and be sure to include differences for cards specific to individual employees and departments versus general corporate cards. If individuals may have access to multiple cards, be sure it’s clear which expense types should be charged to each card.Be prepared to reject inappropriate expensesNo one wants to have to deny a request for reimbursement or approval. But the truth is that employee expense fraud is more common than most people realise.In a 2019 survey from Robert Half Management Resources, 56% of CFOs reported having seen an increase in inappropriate submissions within the past three years. What’s more, travel and expense (T&E) fraud alone makes up 14.5% of all uncovered fraud.So be prepared to reject unauthorised expenses, and don’t be surprised by widely inappropriate purchases. CFOs in the same Robert Half survey mentioned above cited all of the following outrageous submissions:Pogo stick300 tacosChicken statue with a top hatBed bug removalHot air balloon ride$500 cowboy bootsTrip to Italy Lamborghini YachtWhether an employee is requesting $20 for a pogo stick or $500,000 for a yacht, or merely spending more on dinner than necessary, you’re absolutely in your right to deny the request. To make things easier, Borderless cards enable you to allow only specific merchant types and set up notifications for large or unusual purchases.Implement an expense management toolThere’s a tool to make just about everything easier these days, including expense management. Expense management tools are designed to eliminate all manual tasks associated with expense management. They save time, increase productivity, eliminate human error and lend greater insights into your business’ finances.For example, Airwallex’s Expenses and Xero integration enable:Card spending limits: Implement card spending limits for specific use cases, such as travel or client meetings.Easy receipt uploading: Employees can easily log and categorise their transactions, upload receipts and track their expenses.Seamless approval workflows: A few clicks are all it takes to submit, review, and approve expenses — no physical paperwork necessary.Expense tracking: Track spending by employee or card to maintain an up-to-date total.Reporting: Sync your receipts and expense data to facilitate month-end reporting and reconciling.Compliance: Store all of your receipts and tax invoices in one place to ensure you’re never out of compliance.Make business expense management easier with AirwallexOur Borderless cards now feature built-in expense management to turn the back-and-forth with finance into an automatic and seamless workflow.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-do-we-attract-and-retain-the-best-talent,How do we attract and retain the best talent?,"BlogHow do we attract and retain the best talent?Jack Zhang17 February 2022•5 minutesCompany newsRecently I was asked the question ‘what keeps me up at night.’  Being a co-founder and CEO of a young start-up (we just celebrated our 6th anniversary), there are many things I obsess about, but one persistent question I have everyday is - how do we attract the best talent - because, when it comes to hiring, everyone competes for the best. So how do we get the best talent?Success matters. We have earned a good reputation today but I also know we cannot take anything for granted.  We are one of the fastest growing unicorns today.  A valuation increase of over 92X between Series A to Series E is no small feat. Sitting in the Melbourne cafe more than six years ago where the idea of Airwallex originated, my co-founders and I would never have imagined that the company we conceived of would become a unicorn worth US$5.5 billion. Our recent oversubscribed rounds show that we have many investors who believe in our mission and vision. They want to support our growth and participate in our future success. In fact I would hope to see a 5-10x rise in value in the next couple of years.  This wish is not inconceivable. In any case, I am confident that we have a path to creating one of the world’s most valuable technology companies. And a large part of that is ensuring we have the right talent that can support our growth.Monetary worthNaturally, a strong valuation enables us to compensate our employees financially.  One key reason people are attracted to start-ups (compared to a stable and higher cash salary in a more established company) is the opportunity to participate in the upside success of the start-up through Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) and Restricted Share Schemes (RSU).Based on our current valuation, there are almost 100 paper millionaires in Airwallex and I fully expect our high-growth trajectory to continue. Moreover, we recently made available almost $25 million to employees who have been with us for over two years (three in Australia) by enabling those with ESOP to exercise and sell up to 20% of their vested share options. That’s 87 eligible employees (including those who have already left the company and have exercised their options), and while I don’t expect everyone to exercise their rights, this opportunity to monetise their options is clear confirmation of our commitment to reward the best people.  For our employees, this value enables them to achieve their life milestones.  It could be buying their first house – or moving into a new one that gives more room to a growing family.  It might be paying off student debt, or supporting someone going through university.Or, it might just be the first step to a nest egg – it’s difficult to start saving at any time but having a firm financial footing to build upon does make it feel more manageable.Building culture & value for the long termI am equally proud of our employees who have chosen to hold on to their shares because of the confidence they have in the future growth of Airwallex. This vested interest, ownership and share (literally) in the long term success of the business will only propel our talent to perform better everyday to build a company that we are all proud of. Needless to say, there is more to just financial rewards.  We are conducting a review currently to finetune our compensation philosophy so that we can better recognise and reward those who are driving our success. We want to address the individual needs of the talent whom we recruit, and offer better and more sustainable benefits and incentives so that working in Airwallex is a true viable and rewarding career proposition.In the race for talent, other things are also a factor. The number one reason people join Airwallex is the opportunity they get to make an impact professionally and personally.  I realise that a strong culture is what differentiates why someone joins and why they stay in a company.We are still in a very nascent stage of our journey but I am learning the importance of instilling the right values as we grow and I am also learning how to be a better leader.  No one said it would be easy to build a company, which brings me back to where we began.  Like my co-founders, I feel proud of what we have achieved today, and while it is tough and challenging every day, I am most excited about the people we are working with and I will do everything in my power to not only attract the best people, but more importantly retain them and help them grow.  Back to blogShareJack ZhangCo-founder and CEO of AirwallexSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs

What is an interesting fact about yourself? I moved to London a week before the first COVID lockdown so my entire experience in the UK has been in and out of lockdowns (the photo below is a pretty good representation of that). That being said, I’m still very much enjoying living here and the opportunities I’ve had to meet new people and travel to exotic places. A snowy winter's day in London!What motivated you to join Airwallex?I can honestly say it’s the people. Airwallex has such a diverse group of individuals scattered across the globe that it not only creates a collaborative work environment, but also provides a very unique set of viewpoints.Working at a company that is international by nature allows for you to gather different perspectives you might not otherwise have worked somewhere that is siloed to a single location.What’s the best thing about working at Airwallex?One of the best things about working at Airwallex is the diversity of our customers. You might have a call in the morning with a company that’s helping local Scottish fishermen sell their inventory online and by the afternoon you’re working with a multi-billion dollar software company expanding into APAC. Airwallex is a special place because we are not only providing a service, but also the foundation for the next generation of businesses. What has surprised you the most about Airwallex?The biggest surprise I had was with regards to the openness and willingness of team members to help you succeed. There have been multiple instances where my team has been working on a complex problem and a colleague from Singapore or Australia has jumped in to provide their input since they faced a similar situation.What’s your one biggest career lesson? Surround yourself with people who will make you a better person. This was also a big part of the reason why I joined Airwallex. I find that there are a ton of opportunities to take ownership of products or solve complex problems, but also receive guidance and mentorship from leaders within the company.What’s the biggest misconception people have about your position?The biggest misconception with sales, in general, is that sales just wants to get a contract signed and move on. The most successful individuals I’ve worked with build long-lasting relationships with their customers and are experts in their domain. The success of our business is based on the success of our customers. If our customers are not growing and successful, then Airwallex will not be able to grow and be successful. This is why we have ongoing relationships with all of our customers and continue to invest in their long term growth.What do you do for fun outside of work? My two favourite hobbies are travelling and hiking. A few years ago my fiancé and I received our scuba certification which was a bucket list item for me. I was able to swim with sharks and did a bit of cave diving in Belize as well.When I’m not spending time in the ocean I love to go on hikes. This past year (and in between lockdowns) I had the opportunity to visit a few trails in the Scottish Highlands which had breathtaking views. Scuba diving in Belize with my fiancé, Katie!What does your morning routine look like? I’m definitely more of a morning person rather than a night owl. I feel like I can get my best work done as soon as I wake up and want to make sure I am optimising for when I’m at my peak.My standard routine is to wake up, work out, have a coffee, and then immediately dive into my tasks for the day.Everyone operates in a slightly different way and I think it’s important to have an understanding of how you operate at your best. Once you figure that out, take advantage of it and focus on your most critical tasks during this time.What does success look like to you? For me, success equals happiness - and happiness is a byproduct of achieving your goals.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/mission-update-reflecting-on-a-year-of-milestones, Mission Update: Reflecting on a year of milestones,"Blog Mission Update: Reflecting on a year of milestonesShani Ishigaki1 February 2022•10 minutesCompany newsWelcome to our first-ever annual Mission Update.
We’re here to bring you up to speed on how Airwallex is connecting you — the entrepreneurs, business builders, makers and creators — with exciting opportunities in every corner of the world. 
A lot can happen in a year. And we’ve been using this time to deliver faster, cheaper and more transparent financial solutions to help you win new markets and grow your bottom line.
So while we can’t cover everything off, here’s a snapshot (by the numbers) of the progress we made in 2021 and a little of what we’re working to achieve this year.
Here’s to you, our loyal customers
Of all the milestones in 2021, our greatest achievement so far has been supporting you. From small business owners to enterprise CEOs, employees and finance teams of all sizes — thank you for taking your finances further with Airwallex.
Last year many of you had asked for even more ways to operate and integrate payment services without borders. So, we focused on expanding our products to match your needs. With technology at our core, we’ve built global infrastructure and applications to transform financial experiences for our customers and unlock new opportunities for their business in two ways:


We’re listening to you every step of the way. And we’re continuing to improve and build new products that offer even more value, without creating extra effort or cost to you. Part of this comes down to the strong relationships we’ve continued to forge with global banks, regulators and local partners.
Speeding up your day-to-day operations
In 2021, we doubled down on speed to make overseas transactions faster than ever. It’s no surprise the number of overseas transfers facilitated by Airwallex grew 5x. 
By working with local payment systems, we’re able to facilitate international payments in real-time. Think of us as a hub connecting faster flight pathways between hundreds of banks and payment systems worldwide. 

In 2021, you deposited more money into Airwallex than ever before. And to save you the hassle of manually transferring funds from your external accounts, we’re releasing auto top-up options for your business account and transfers.

Reducing your costs and overheads globally
We’ve been working hard to reduce costs by building great relationships with banks and payment systems, adding to our impressive breadth of currencies, countries and settlement configurations, and leveraging our recent Series E1 funding and rapid growth to make this possible. Our local payment network now penetrates more than 100 countries through integrations with more than 80 banks!
Thousands of you waved goodbye to the excessive fees and wasteful overheads that were holding your business back and have been loving our simple, transparent pricing.
Web-based proposal company Qwilr is now saving USD 7,200 per month in unnecessary fees and administration hours by using Borderless Cards.

And fast-growing ambassador marketing platform Brandbassador started using Airwallex to avoid a 3% fee from forced FX conversions back to GBP when using Stripe to collect USD.
Adding new currencies
We want to offer full global coverage, like no business, bank or fintech ever thought possible. In 2021, we added 15 new currencies, meaning you can now do things like pay out a supplier in Mexico, convert ZAR from South African customers to USD, and hold NOK to pay for your subscriptions in Norway — all without you or your customers having to bear the cost.
New currencies: MXN, ILS, ZAR, SEK, NOK, CZK, HUF, HRK, RON, PLN, BDT, LKR, NPR, PKR, TRY.Putting your spend management on autopilot
Our philosophy is that borderless business shouldn’t just be possible. It should be effortless. 
We first introduced our multi-currency Virtual Cards two years ago in Australia, and have since rolled this out to Hong Kong, the UK and soon in the US. This gives you total control and visibility over your payments, and makes it easier and more affordable to manage your software subscriptions, team budgets, travel, and everything your business needs. 
Since then, we’ve matured quickly, adding Digital Wallets (Apple Pay and Google Pay™) and Physical Cards, so you can pay the way you want, wherever you are in the world.
If you’re based in Australia, the US, Hong Kong or the UK, these cards will soon come with in-built expense management so you can set spending limits and track your entire team’s transactions in one place.This is where your cards are being used:What were your favourite ways to use Borderless Cards in 2021? It should come as no surprise that most of you spent big on digital advertising, software subscriptions and cloud computing services — with tech adoption accelerated by the shift to remote work and distributed teams.

More ways to get paidWe wanted to give businesses the power to reach customers and new revenue streams without borders. And we delivered on that promise.
In 2021, we launched a global-first payment processor to help you increase sales and win back your profit margin with the launch of Online Payments. Now, your customers can enjoy a swift checkout experience and make purchases with their preferred payment method. 170+ countries and counting.

We also launched Payment Links so you can accept domestic and international payments in minutes, without a website or app. So far, you’ve already generated thousands of links or QR codes to sell a product or service or start a subscription.
And to make it effortless for you to capitalise on the Japanese market, we added JPY Global Accounts to our existing 11 foreign currency accounts. That means you can instantly collect and hold customer funds in Japanese Yen without the hassle of visiting a bank branch.Expanding into new markets
We have rapidly expanded our geographic footprint in the last year. We’re proud to say that we successfully launched our services in both EMEA and US markets, while strengthening our foothold in Australia, Hong Kong and China. And since we’re only one month into 2022, we may as well mention our recent launch in Singapore!
Helping you monetise new channels
Just like you, we’re continuing to innovate. We’ve been working tirelessly to help our growing base of Platform customers discover even more revenue opportunities. For those of you who are still getting acquainted with our APIs, Airwallex also lets you monetise new channels without having to build your own infrastructure from scratch.
In 2021, up-and-coming wealthtech company, Stake, accelerated their growth by introducing ASX share trading and the beta launch of their self-managed super fund product in Australia. This partnership will also pave the way for Stake’s international expansion into the UK, New Zealand and Brazil.
Helping you become a fintech, tooRemoving the barriers to help you deliver innovative products and experiences to your own customers was top priority for us in 2021. It’s astonishing to think that we are now helping you to become a 21st-century fintech without the need for licences!

Keeping your money safe and secure
Security and compliance are always at the core of our business. In 2021, we were proud to reinforce our commitment to your safety and privacy by becoming SOC2 Type 2 compliant. We value the trust our customers place in us to manage their finances and build their business on our infrastructure. SOC2 enables us to maintain that trust as we continue to scale our products globally by continually evaluating our mechanisms and improving our security protocols.
We’ve also been leading the fight against fraud and financial crime over the past year. We’ve built several risk management solutions to protect our customers and platform from cybercriminals, like improving our Global Trade Point Network (GTPN) fraud detection and prevention controls and optimising our transaction monitoring models from end to end.
If you use Online Payments and Payment Links, you’ll know you’re in safe hands. We are building the very best fraud detection and prevention models and rules to defend merchants from potential threats. And in 2022, we’ll continue to enable a safe and secure payment network for our customers.Delighting you was mission-critical
Speaking of our customers, our mission has always been about you. No matter how fast we grow, or how big we get, we never lose sight of why Airwallex was built in the first place. The products and services we built on in 2021 are designed to solve real, common problems.In late 2021, we were thrilled to introduce a new low-friction onboarding experience designed to get you saving as quickly as possible. As always, your satisfaction and confidence in us are mission-critical.We couldn’t have done it without you

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/a-message-from-our-co-founder-and-ceo,A message from our Co-founder and CEO,"BlogA message from our Co-founder and CEOJack Zhang27 January 2022•10 minutesCompany newsOver the past year, we continued on our journey to build one of the largest global financial infrastructures through expanding our platform capabilities and geographic footprint. We also continued to build and launch software to solve business operating issues for different verticals, further supporting businesses. Today, we have enabled a programmatic money movement network that penetrates more than 100 countries. We’ve also introduced new products and channels to support our customers.After a successful year at Airwallex, here are some of the highlights from 2021. 1. Our launch into the U.S. and Europe. A big focus for us last year was to expand in international markets. In the U.S., we secured Money Transfer Licenses or received exemptions in almost all of the 50 states (plus additional territories) that enable us to operate across the nation. With a growing team of 50, we now offer our Treasury & FX products and will be launching our cards product very soon. Furthermore, securing our EMI license in the Netherlands in addition to our UK license gave us the ability to offer our suite of services to customers in Europe. Today, we have a team of nearly 100 employees to support our growth across EMEA.2. Marked entry into the ASEAN region. Near the end of the year we secured licenses in Singapore and Malaysia - we have since also announced our launch into Singapore to kick-off 2022. This is an incredibly dynamic region, and one where we recognise the need for more efficient and effective cross-border payment solutions with a trusted global partner. We will take what we’ve learned in our other markets and aim to replicate the same success across ASEAN. 3. Scaling our China business. In one of the world’s largest economies, we have made strides to ensure we continue to distinguish ourselves and be the most innovative provider in fintech. In the last year, we have seen a triple-digit growth rate in revenue, driven by a strong and diversified team that has enabled us to further evolve the business. We more than doubled our customer base last year, and also launched a series of new payments and issuing products that has put us in a much more differentiated position in the market to become a truly integrated pay-in, pay-out platform to support our customers’ global needs. 4. Achieving better product-market fit. Tapping into a market as large as solving payments for global businesses is no small task, and to achieve that we take pride in connecting with our customers. Their feedback helps us consider how we design our product offerings. A business in Australia will clearly have different needs to another in the UK or Hong Kong. Our teams are informed by customer research to determine how we build and evolve our products. We did a lot of this last year, particularly during Covid-19 when different businesses around the globe needed help in different ways. In Hong Kong for example, we launched our Borderless Cards in partnership with Visa as well as our online payments solution. In the UK, we created a broader product suite from the get-go, as businesses there were looking for an all-in-one solution for their financial needs. 5. Launch of Online Payments. We want to help our customers grow their revenue globally, and provide more convenient and safe ways to manage their global payment needs. The introduction of our online payments capability allows for customers to get paid in over 130+ currencies, and receive payments in their preferred currency. 6. New software products. In addition to extending our existing network capabilities, we are also building a software layer on top of our financial infrastructure. This involves the constant development of innovative products, to help businesses operate with greater transparency and control. Last year, we rolled out our Airwallex Borderless Cards and started to beta test our expense management products. We also launched our Get Paid solution with payment links, enabling businesses to get paid online from their customers with one click of a button.7. Extended network of engineering hubs. We now have five engineering hubs across the globe, after introducing two additional hubs in Sydney and San Francisco last year. The expanded network highlights our commitment to be on the forefront of innovation - we are always looking at ways to build and enhance our products, and to attract the best engineering talent worldwide.  8. Enabling better financial capabilities for technology-first customers. We are continuing to build out our API solutions to better meet the needs for technology-first businesses. We recognise the evolving regulations in many parts of the world, and have been working hard so platforms can leverage our payments network and regulatory infrastructure to launch embedded financial products, on top of our developer friendly APIs. Today, we are serving innovative businesses such as GOAT, Papaya Global and Stake, and look forward to supporting even more. 9. Continued priority on customer privacy and data protection. Last year, we received our SOC2 Type2 Report, a testament to our commitment to protect our customer’s data, and provide them with a secure and reliable platform that supports their business growth. Safeguarding and protecting our customers is a fundamental commitment we stand by. 10. Record fundraising. To spur our global growth, we raised an additional US$400 million last year, more than doubling our valuation to US$5.5b in just six months’ time. We are excited to be supported by a strong bench of investors who believe in our vision for Airwallex, and welcomed several new investors, including Lone Pine Capital and Greenoaks who bring to the table a wealth of experience and industry knowledge. 11. Investing in our people and talent. 2021 was a year that brought a lot of excitement, learning and growth for the business. People are our greatest assets, and as a fast-growing business, I am fortunate to be surrounded by a team who share the same vision and purpose, even amid another challenging year with the pandemic. Last year, we saw our team double to now more than 1,000 across 19 locations globally.  We invested in a global employee engagement tool to improve our culture and ways of working, and we continue our global search for great talent who share the same values and are just as eager to make an impact.So as we look ahead to the rest of 2022, the world is continuing to live with COVID but Airwallex remains resolved to deliver our vision - to better scale the business, better serve our customers and to better support our employees during such unprecedented times.We will continue to accelerate our growth worldwide.Our success lies in our ability to maintain our competitive advantage, and that is why we will continue to focus on building a secure and scalable tech infrastructure that can help our customers grow globally.We have great ambitions to become the backbone of global commerce and the digital economy. But more importantly, we have a bigger purpose to leave our mark and make a difference. We will connect the entrepreneurs, business builders, makers and creators with opportunities in every corner of the world, to ensure they succeed, no matter when, what or where. Here’s to a Bigger, Better, Bolder 2022.Jack ZhangCo-founder and CEO at Airwallex Back to blogShareJack ZhangCo-founder and CEO of AirwallexSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-retained-profit,The advantages and disadvantages of retained profit,"BlogThe advantages and disadvantages of retained profitTilly Michell18 January 2022•3 minutesBusiness tipsFinanceIn this article•What is retained profit?•What are the advantages of retained profit?•What are the disadvantages of retained profit?•How much profit should a company retain?•Boost profits with an Airwallex accountCreating and selling products and services is just one part of running a successful business. Once the money starts flowing in, you need to decide how to allocate your revenue. If the business is publicly owned, do you pay out dividends, or do you keep the money in the business?This decision can have a big impact on the long-term success of your business, and there are several factors to consider before making up your mind.  First, it’s important to understand the core terminology.What is retained profit?Also known as ‘retained earnings,’ ‘trading profits,’ or ‘earnings surplus,’ this is money held in the business, rather than paid out to shareholders. It’s a form of equity that is an important measure of a company’s financial stability, and one in which potential investors will be interested. It’s also a term that’s crucial to the field of accounting. On financial statements, a company can ‘bring forward’ its retained profit from one period to the next, with the money accumulating over time.What are the advantages of retained profit?Invest in expansionA company that’s focused on growth may pay low or no dividends, because it makes more sense to finance expansion activities. The idea is that more money can be made for everyone (including shareholders) in the long run. Create a safety netThere are ups and downs in any business, and it’s important to have a plan for a sudden downturn. If a certain initiative turns out to be less profitable than hoped or an unexpected expense arises, it may be possible to borrow money, but this can come with limits and costs. Having money in the bank provides security and doesn’t come with lenders’ fees.Boost investor confidenceMore money in the company’s coffers makes the business look like a more attractive prospect to potential investors. The balance sheet’s bigger; there’s more stability. This can raise the share price, and attract investment, which could create a virtuous cycle of growth.What are the disadvantages of retained profit?InefficiencyEarly-stage companies may want to keep things simple, and only spend the money they already have. But for some businesses, borrowing might make more sense than retained profit. The average annualised return for the S&P 500 is more than 10%, so if your company can borrow at 5%, it could be a calculated risk worth taking. Look at Apple: its annual retained earnings in 2021 were $5.6B. In 2013, the figure was $116.6B. However, its stock price and market capitalisation has grown during that time. Shareholder dissatisfactionSome shareholders may see the wisdom in a company reinvesting money and potentially boosting stock prices, leading to long-term growth. Others may be after shorter-term wins, and become disgruntled if they don’t receive regular payouts. Potential investors will be aware of the dividend stream, too, and it will affect their opinion of the company accordingly.How much profit should a company retain?The answer to this question depends on everything that makes that business unique. What financial obligations does the company have? What are the goals, and are they long-term or short-term? What’s the appetite for risk?These are the types of questions company leaders should be asking themselves when making decisions about retained profits versus shareholder dividends.Boost profits with an Airwallex accountThe amount of profit a company retains is affected not only by shareholder considerations, but by how much revenue is coming in and what costs are going out. Airwallex is the borderless business account that can help you unlock new global markets without losing money in unnecessary FX fees. Collect payments from your customers in their local currency with no forced conversions, and send money across borders without paying international fees. You can also create borderless cards for your team in minutes, and manage expenses at home and abroad from one account with no transaction fees. To find out how Airwallex can help you streamline your finances and boost your business, click below to watch a three-minute demo or sign up for a free account today. Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

With international suppliers as well as customers, they needed a global business account that would allow them to collect and send funds in multiple currencies without excessive fees. “The bulk of our manufacturing is done in Portugal, so paying the manufacturers through Airwallex has actually been a dream,” says Young Goat co-founder Arthur Leventhorpe. “It’s so much easier and the exchange rate you get is incredible. It means I can do it on my own without getting a trader in.” Young Goat’s mission The idea behind Young Goat is that anyone can be ‘the GOAT’, an acronym meaning ‘Greatest Of All Time’. For the Young Goat founders, calling someone ‘the GOAT’ was a way of lifting them up and giving them confidence. With mental health issues on the rise at their university, the founders saw the difference that this simple affirmation could make to a person’s self esteem. Young Goat’s mission is to share this positive energy with their customers, helping them become the best version of themselves. During Black History Month last year, Young Goat released a t-shirt with all profits going to Black Minds Matter. As well as raising money, Arthur hopes the campaign raised awareness about the great work the charity does.   Arthur knows firsthand how poor mental health can impact a young person’s life. “Good mental health is inherently linked to our brand identity,” he says. “Which is why I’ve always wanted to give back to mental health charities.”How Young Goat took their brand globalYoung Goat’s mission statement—that anyone can be the GOAT, no matter who they are or where they come from—encouraged the founders to take their brand beyond the UK. “The international reach that we’ve garnered has reinforced the idea that this is a concept for everyone,” says Arthur. “How can we say that anyone can be the GOAT, but only sell in the UK?”International expansion inevitably came with some challenges. The cost of fulfilling orders abroad, and sending money to international suppliers, was an early obstacle. Young Goat was designed to be an accessible brand, so the team didn’t want the cost of international trade to drive up their prices. Opening a global business account with Airwallex has allowed them to cut the cost of managing their money across borders. These cost savings are fed straight back to their customers, allowing Young Goat to keep their products affordable. This year, the team plans to expand their reach further, growing their product range and branching into women’s wear. They’re also hoping to get Young Goat products stocked in European shops, further building on their international success. A global account for fast-growing businesses Airwallex helps businesses like Young Goat push into new markets, without the associated costs and admin burdens that can come from trading across borders.If you’d like to learn more about how Airwallex can help your business cut the cost of sending and receiving money abroad, you can sign up online or click the banner below to watch a 3-minute demo.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-is-open-banking,"What is open banking, how does it work, and why does it matter?","BlogWhat is open banking, how does it work, and why does it matter?Tilly Michell3 January 2022•4 minutes TechnologyFinanceIn this article•The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)  •What are APIs, PISPs and AISPs?•How does open banking work in practice?•Is open banking secure?•Which banks support open banking?•Airwallex’s open banking solution•The future of open banking•What’s next?If you’ve ever used a budgeting app to track your spending, applied for finance online, or used accounting software to manage your bookkeeping, chances are you’ve used open banking. In this article, we’ll discuss what open banking is, how it works, and how it’s shaping the financial landscape in the UK and Europe. The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)  In 2016, the EU passed regulation requiring Europe’s banks and other payment service providers to share financial data with authorised third parties through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) when requested to do so by their customers. This opened the door for what we now know as open banking. The legislation, called the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), made it easier for financial service providers that are independent from banks to offer quick and secure online solutions to their customers using the data held by their banks. It also gave fintechs the green light to develop new products which reimagined how businesses and individuals could manage their money. What are APIs, PISPs and AISPs?You can’t understand open banking without first grasping what an API, a PISP and an AISP are. API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs allow computer programs to quickly and securely share information with one another. With fast access to your financial information, companies can speed up processes that used to take days or weeks, such as approving you for credit. APIs also allow companies to speed up money transfers and make online payments more secure.   AISP stands for Account Information Service Provider. AISPs are authorised to access users’ financial data through APIs. An example of an AISP is accounting software providers like Xero and FreeAgent, which use APIs to access users’ banking data in order to automate bookkeeping. Another example of an AISP is Credit Kudos, which allows users to share their financial data with lenders when applying for loans.  PISP stands for Payment Initiation Service Provider. PISPs can initiate payments directly from a user's bank account (with the user’s consent) without the need for credit or debit card details. They do this using the user’s bank's APIs. PISPs can make online payments faster and can protect customers against credit and debit card fraud. Examples of PISPs include Vipps, MobilPay and Swish. AISPs and PISPs are often referred to as Third Party Providers (“TPPs”).How does open banking work in practice?Before they offer you their services, financial companies often need information from your bank. Depending on the service they provide, this information can include your transaction data and how much money you have in your account.In the past, unless the service provider was also a bank, this information was generally obtained through time-consuming manual requests. With open banking, authorised companies can request this information directly from your bank, who are obliged to share it via an API with your consent. Over the past five years, tech companies have used open banking to develop innovative solutions for both the personal and business finance markets. These include apps that allow you to pay with your phone, software that automates your accounts, and platforms that help you budget and forecast. Is open banking secure?Open banking is just as secure, if not more secure, than sharing data manually. PSD2 set very strict rules and security standards for communication between payment services providers and TPPs via APIs.  All TPPs must be registered with and are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK, or an equivalent body in Europe, and your personal information is protected under data protection laws. The API connection points are monitored by the banks themselves, and are therefore put through rigorous testing, both by the banks and by external regulators. Most importantly, your bank will never share your data with a third party without your permission. Which banks support open banking?The short answer is: most of them. Europe’s biggest banks and building societies are legally required to support open banking, but many smaller banks and challenger banks choose to. The full list of European banks and building societies which support open banking can be found on the official open banking website.Airwallex’s open banking solutionThe Airwallex open banking solution gives our clients the opportunity to securely share their account information with third-party providers. This is useful for clients who want to connect their Airwallex account with other fintech solutions, such as Xero and Finvertex. Our open banking solution also allows Airwallex to accept requests from TPPs automatically via an API.The future of open bankingA recent report from trade association UK Finance called for open banking standards to be further developed, and a standardised framework to be established to prevent market fragmentation. In layman's terms, they see a future in which all banks use the same standards for approving payments. This consistency would improve competition in the market, by enhancing what PISPs can offer consumers in terms of transparency when making payments.  What’s next?For many European businesses, open banking has become an essential part of financial management. Whilst many regions and countries are working on open banking infrastructure, Europe is leading the way. According to Nordigen, 40-50% of open banking users worldwide are based in Europe, with the UK, Germany and Sweden being the top three countries when it comes to open banking implementation. With cooperation from leading institutions, open banking will make the future of financial management faster, cheaper and more efficient for businesses and individuals alike. Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-best-way-to-transfer-money-from-the-uk-to-the-us,The best way to transfer money from the UK to the US,"BlogThe best way to transfer money from the UK to the USTilly Michell20 December 2021•2 minutesBusiness tipsFinanceIn this article•Transfer money via a high street bank •Send money via a money transfer service•Open a multi-currency account•Which option is right for you?If you’re a UK business with suppliers, employees or partners in the States, finding the best way to transfer money from the UK to the US can save you a chunk of money and help keep your business running smoothly. In this article, we’ll compare different ways to send money from the UK to the US, and help you decide which method is right for you. Transfer money via a high street bank If you choose to send money from the UK to the US via a high street bank, your bank will complete the transfer via the SWIFT network.  There are lots of reasons you might choose to send money this way. Firstly, you’ve probably been with the same bank for years and you trust them. Secondly, it’s easy, and doesn’t require any additional research. However, there are several drawbacks to this type of money transfer: 1) The costSWIFT payments cost between £20 - £25. On top of this flat fee, banks charge between 2.6 - 3.5% above the interbank rate for currency exchange. That means if you send £100,000 to the US, you could be looking at a £3,525 fee before the money gets there!2) The wait timeSWIFT payments take 1-4 working days to clear, which is frustrating if you’re on a deadline. In most instances, suppliers won't release goods until they have received payment, so slow money transfers can cause delays to your supply chain. 3) The lack of transparencyBanks aren’t always upfront about their fees, and their exchange rates can be confusing. You might not know exactly how much you’re going to be charged until after you’ve transferred your money. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to keep track of the cost of managing your money across borders. Send money via a money transfer serviceMoney transfer services like Western Union, Xoom and MoneyGram were designed to help people send money abroad without using the banks. This type of money transfer is usually faster than the banks and marginally cheaper. For example, Western Union charges 2% above the interbank rate for international transfers.   Money transfer services are primarily used by individuals sending money to friends and family abroad. They have an upper transfer limit of £50,000 or less, and are not the cheapest option for businesses.  Open a multi-currency accountBy far the best option for UK businesses that want to send money to the US quickly, securely and cost-effectively, is to open a multi-currency account.With an Airwallex multi-currency account, you can make same-day transfers from the UK to the US and pay just 0.5% above the interbank rate for currency exchange. That’s 85% cheaper than high street banks and money transfer services. Because Airwallex uses a network of local bank accounts to transfer money, rather than the SWIFT network, we’re able to get your money where it needs to go fast and without unnecessary fees. The second benefit of a multi-currency account is that—as the name suggests—they allow you to hold many currencies in your account at one time. This is essential for businesses that trade across borders. Say your business has customers and suppliers in the US. You can collect dollars from your customers into your account without exchanging them into pounds sterling, then transfer those dollars to your US suppliers when the time comes. This type of money transfer is fast and, best of all, free!Which option is right for you?If your business regularly collects and sends money across borders, opening a multi-currency account is by far the best way to cut out high transfer and exchange fees and improve your profit margins. A recent Airwallex survey found that 77% of UK businesses want to expand their international presence in 2022.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-write-a-killer-business-plan,How to write a killer business plan,"BlogHow to write a killer business planTilly Michell17 December 2021•3 minutesBusiness tipsGuidesIn this article•What is a business plan?•Step-by-step guide to writing a business plan•Reduce business expenses with AirwallexWhat is a business plan?To move forward with a business concept or steer an existing company into the future, you need a clear idea of where you’re heading and how to get there.A business plan will ensure that you are firm in your own intentions, and guide you when targets are being missed or the way ahead is unclear.Business plans are also essential for getting others on board, including investors, partners and early hires. For people to trust you with their money and time, they need to thoroughly understand your goals and the steps you're going to take to reach them.Step-by-step guide to writing a business plan1) Executive summaryThe executive summary sits at the very start your business plan, but you may want to write it last, as it is essentially an overview of your proposal. The executive summary can be thought of as an ‘elevator pitch’. If you only had a few moments of an investor's time, how would you succinctly and convincingly persuade them that you have a brilliant and workable business model?Key to the executive summary is the company’s unique selling point; what sets you apart from the competition. You may also want to mention how you’ll operate, your target audience, sales projections and any investment needed.2) Your businessThis is where you start getting into the fine details. Ask yourself what problem you are solving for customers, and how your method will differ from the competition.In this section you can also outline how long your business has been established, what kind of experience you have if the business is new, and the legal structure of the company.You also want to capture the company’s overarching aims. What is your mission statement, or driving purpose? What are the business objectives?When setting up these goals, try to make them SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely.3) Market analysisIdeally, you will have done some research into your customer base and the existing market for the type of product or service you’re offering. This can be quantitative (based on measurable data), qualitative (based on individual opinions and experiences) or a mixture of the two.Once you have this information, you can explain who your target market is, its size and likely behaviour. If the market is likely to change or grow, this transformation and its reasons can be predicted in outline form.Another important part of market research is analysing the competition. How will you differ in your approach from similar businesses, and how will you find an edge?4) Strengths and weaknessesMany business plans include a grid showing the business’s strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities.At this point, you should get specific about your USP: that perfect point of overlap between what customers want, what you can do well, and what competitors aren’t doing a good job at offering.However you wish to craft this section, it’s a chance to demonstrate thorough understanding of the challenges facing you, and the aspects of the company that are most worth highlighting and steering towards.5) OperationAt this point in the plan, you’ll want to drill down into how things will run. You may want to go over the management and company structure, with information about the achievements and professional background of each team member.Details on the products and services offered can also be introduced, along with pricing, marketing and sales strategy, and funding information, if applicable.6) FinancialsA good place to end is financial projections. This includes a breakdown of the costs you’ll incur, the funds you need, and the expected revenue in a given timeframe. It’s possible to present this numerically or graphically.Any supporting information, such as reference letters and credit reports, can be added in a subsequent appendix.Reduce business expenses with AirwallexCalculating business costs is an important part of any business plan, and every reduction in expenses is a worthwhile step towards financial success.Airwallex is a business account that saves you money by reducing the cost of collecting and transferring multiple currencies across borders.  Virtual debit cards, integration with Xero and online payment acceptance make Airwallex a no-fuss solution for any company with international team members, customers or clients.If you’d like to learn how an Airwallex foreign currency account can help you manage your money more efficiently, apply online today, or click below to watch a 3-minute demo.Related article: What Is a Business Continuity Plan?Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-open-a-euro-business-bank-account-from-the-uk,How to open a euro business bank account from the UK,"BlogHow to open a euro business bank account from the UKTilly Michell14 December 2021•3 FinanceBusiness tipsIn this article•What is a euro business bank account? •Why open a euro business bank account?•The best euro account options for UK businesses•How to open a euro bank account from the UKIf you’re a UK business with customers or suppliers in Europe, opening a euro business bank account can save you a lot of money. If you don’t have a euro account, you will be charged currency conversion fees every time you collect payment from your European customers, send money to your European suppliers, or pay for expenses in euros. By opening a euro account from the UK, you can avoid these fees and significantly increase your profit margins. What is a euro business bank account? A euro business bank account is similar to a sterling business bank account, except rather than holding pound sterling, it holds euros.  By opening a euro business account from the UK, you can collect, hold and send euros whilst avoiding unnecessary currency exchange fees and cross border transaction charges.Depending on the account provider you choose, you may receive a debit card when you open a euro business bank account, which you can use to pay expenses in euros without being subject to fees. You can open a free euro business account with Airwallex online and start spending and collecting euros across borders with zero charges.   Why open a euro business bank account?Between 2021 and 2027, the cross-border eCommerce market is projected to grow at an annual CAGR of 27%, reaching $4,820 billion by 2026. Overseas expansion presents countless opportunities for UK businesses. But unless firms adapt their banking strategy, they could end up cutting a chunk out of their bottom line. Here are some examples of how your business could be stung:Collecting revenue from eCommece platforms: when your European customers pay in their local currency via PayPal, Amazon or Stripe, you will be charged cross border fees and a steep currency conversion rate if you collect those currencies into a sterling bank account. These fees can be as high as 6.7% per transaction. 
Paying international suppliers: high street banks charge between 2.6 - 3.5% above the interbank rate for currency exchange. That means if you pay your European suppliers £100,000 a year, you could end up paying out £3,500 to the banks, just for the privilege of sending money abroad. 
 Paying European employees: the rise of remote working has allowed more businesses to employ overseas staff. But unless you have a euro account, every time you pay your European employees, the banks will take a cut.  
Paying for international expenses: many tech companies, including Facebook, Google and LinkedIn are billed outside the UK. If you pay for your online ads or software subscriptions from a sterling account, you may be hit with fees. 
 Spending abroad: if you or your employees take regular business trips to the continent, you'll be charged a fee every time you use your debit or credit card, unless that card is linked to a euro account. Over the course of a year, your business could rack up hundreds of thousands in unnecessary fees. Fortunately, these fees are easily avoidable if you set up an international account.  The best euro account options for UK businessesOnce you’ve decided to open a euro account, you have a couple of options: 1) Apply for a foreign currency account with a bank High street banks will allow you to open a euro account if your business meets their criteria. The only snag is that high street banks charge a variety of fees on foreign currency accounts. These include:Account fees ranging from £24 - £60 per year Fees for paying out and receiving money, between £6 - £25 per transactionNon-sterling debit card charges up to 2.75% of the transaction valueCash withdrawal charges between 1.5 - 2.75 %Currency exchange fees between 2.6 - 3.5% above the interbank rateIn short, opening an euro business account with a traditional bank will help you curb the cost of collecting and transferring large sums of money to Europe. But it won’t help you save on other costs, such as paying smaller international expenses, receiving payment from customers, using a debit card abroad, or converting euros to pound sterling.  2) Open a free Global Business Account with Airwallex If you want to make your business truly borderless, a better option is to sign up for a free Global Business Account with Airwallex. With an Airwallex account, you can open multiple foreign domicile bank accounts at the click of a button. This means you can collect customer payments in multiple currencies—including Euros, USD, Chinese Yuan, and more—into your account without being subject to high fees.  The benefits of Airwallex include:Zero account fees Zero transaction fees when sending and receiving currencies across bordersCollect payments from eCommerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay without being subject to cross border fees or high FX rates, saving you up to 4% on each transactionZero transaction fees when you spend in euros with our borderless debit card, at home or abroad Currency exchange between 0.5 - 1% above the interbank rateSo whether you’re collecting payments from customers, sending money to suppliers, or paying with your borderless card, you won’t be hit with unnecessary fees. You’ll also have the advantage of managing multiple currencies from a single account.How to open a euro bank account from the UK
It's easy to open a euro bank from from the comfort of your home. Applying for an international business account is similar to applying for a sterling business account. Sign up online and you will be asked some simple questions about your company, before being prompted to upload some documentation to prove your identity. This will include:Proof of identity, such as a picture of your passport or driving license. Proof of address such as a bill or bank statement (if you’re a sole trader or freelancer).Certificate of incorporation, memorandum and articles of association (if you’re a limited company).Your provider will then check your eligibility and be in touch to set up your account. The process should take between 2 - 5 business days. Unsure which provider to choose? Visit our business bank account comparison page to weigh up the benefits and fees of the UK's leading banks and FinTechs, including Starling, Barclays, NatWest an Airwallex. Final thoughtsExpanding your business to the EU used to come with a hefty price tag.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-calculate-cost-of-sales-for-your-business,How to calculate cost of sales for your business,"BlogHow to calculate cost of sales for your businessTilly Michell13 December 2021•3 minutesFinanceBusiness tipsIn this article•What is cost of sales?•How to calculate cost of sales•What is the formula for calculating cost of sales?•Why is cost of sales important for your business?•Airwallex can help you manage your money across borders more efficientlyWhen running a successful company, it’s crucial that you stay on top of how money flows in and out of your business. One of the key metrics you need to understand is cost of sales.Assessing the financial health of your business can be a daunting prospect, but once you understand key terms, it’s easy to break the process down into easy-to-execute steps.In this article we’ll talk you through the ins and outs of cost of sales, and why it’s such a vital concept for businesses.What is cost of sales?Also described as the cost of goods sold, cost of sales is a metric that measures the amount of money that goes into creating or acquiring the products you sell.There are all sorts of expenses associated with running a business, from marketing to keeping the office fridge stocked. Cost of sales refers to the expenses directly involved in producing your goods.For service-based businesses or those that don’t carry inventory, cost of sales is a less important metric.How to calculate cost of salesIt might not be immediately obvious which expenses you should include in a cost of sales calculation and which you should leave out.The simplest way to make the decision is to imagine what would happen if you stopped paying for a certain expense. Would you still have a product to sell?If you can’t produce your product without a certain cost, you can feel confident that it should be included in your cost of sales calculation. That doesn’t mean you should only include the cost of raw materials in your calculations. Manufacturing and storage costs, and even the cost of licensing software may be necessary to get your products made.If your business doesn't make products but buys them to sell on, you will use the amount you paid your suppliers and the cost of shipping your products to your warehouse in your cost of sales calculation.  Other expenses may help increase sales, retain staff, and create a positive working environment, but if your product would still exist without them, they don’t count towards the cost of sales.What is the formula for calculating cost of sales?The formula for calculating your cost of sales is:Cost of sales = beginning inventory + purchases – ending inventoryIf you are calculating the cost of sales for a certain time period (eg the tax year), you need to figure out how much stock you had at the beginning and end of that period, and the amount of money it cost your business to produce or buy that stock. That’s your inventory. ‘Purchases’ refers to the cost of manufacturing or buying any new stock which was added to your inventory during the time period in question. Why is cost of sales important for your business?All businesses need to track their financial performance to ensure their continued success. If costs rise or profits fall, you need to know what adjustments can be made to put things right. Cost of sales helps you understand how your product investment translates into profit for your business. Once you've calculated your cost of sales, you can also find out your gross profit, using the formula:Revenue - cost of sales = gross profitNote, to work out your net profit, you will need to deduct other expenses, including all operating, tax and interest expenses. Once you know your cost of sales, and thus your gross profit, you can determine the efficiency of your business. Do you need to switch suppliers or raise your prices? How much money is left over to pay off debts? Is your profitability improving or declining over time?Airwallex can help you manage your money across borders more efficientlyAirwallex is a business account that helps you reduce the cost of trading across borders.With an Airwallex foreign currency account, you can collect, hold and send money in multiple currencies around the world whilst avoiding unnecessary conversion and transfer fees.What's more, your Airwallex account is seamlessly integrated with Xero, so your bookkeeping will be updated automatically. To see how we can help you stay on top of your business expenses, lower costs and maximise profitability, click below to watch a 3-minute demo.Related article: Break-even analysisBack to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

Their business buys Amazon FBA companies and grows them into market-leading brands. With respective backgrounds in private equity and the Amazon marketplace, the brothers knew they had the skills to successfully acquire and scale ecommerce brands across borders. A truly international company, Olsam’s team is headquartered in the UK and has employees in South Africa and the Philippines. They trade across global marketplaces, including the US, Europe, and the UK, and have plans to expand into Australia and Asia Pacific. When searching for a global business account, they knew they needed a platform with a slick onboarding process that would allow them to integrate their newly acquired brands quickly and efficiently. And so they came to Airwallex. “The customer service and the responsiveness of Airwallex is a massive reason why we’ve chosen to work with you,” says Sam. “We’re having to set up new accounts all the time, if we hit roadblocks we know we can email or call, and we’ll have a timely response.”How Olsam stands out from the crowdEcommerce aggregation has mushroomed in the past two years, with Amazon acquirers attracting more than $12 billion in investment between them since 2020, according to Marketplace Pulse. What makes Olsam stand out is their first-hand experience of the Amazon marketplace. “We have a great skill set within the team,” says Olsam’s Finance Director, Martyn Firth. “A lot of people who manage our teams are ex-Amazon employees, so they really know the space. We have great ambitions to grow the businesses in terms of new territories and to optimise our cash position and the efficiencies we can build.”The coming year will bring greater international expansion for Olsam, particularly in the US and China. The business is also making plans to partner with other Amazon FBA acquirers and grow their portfolio further.  Another key focus for Sam in 2022 will be product sourcing. He is keen to ensure that the materials used in their supply chain are of the highest quality, whilst being sustainable. With Airwallex in place, Olsam can collect customer payments from their numerous Amazon stores in multiple currencies without being subject to forced FX conversions. Airwallex also enables them to sidestep unnecessary transfer and exchange fees when paying international suppliers. Airwallex helps Olsam manage their finances across bordersOlsam is one company with many faces. Each brand they acquire has its own set of financial accounts, which need to be individually tracked and fed into the business’ central accounting systems.  Managing multiple brands across borders in several currencies could present some challenges, but Airwallex allows Olsam to onboard their new enterprises and track their accounts easily within a single interface. “Airwallex allows us to switch between multiple business bank accounts with one log in, allowing easier management of multiple subsidiaries,” says Martyn.  ”And being able to integrate with Xero is really beneficial.”For Sam, it’s the Airwallex platform and the efficient onboarding process that makes us the payment provider of choice for Olsam. “If you’re looking for a scalable and slick onboarding and set up process for each acquisition, Airwallex is fantastic,” says Sam. “It also provides a great interface for viewing a consolidated list of seller centrals and Amazon stores in a nice dashboard. The design is very helpful for businesses like us.” The global account for global businessesAirwallex gives companies like Olsam full control of their finances across countries, currencies and brands. We cut down the cost and administrative burdens usually associated with international trade, making global expansion that much easier. To find out how Airwallex could help your business scale internationally without the added costs, sign up online or click below to watch a three-minute demo.Related article: What's the Difference Between CHAPS and BACS Payments?Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-manage-business-expenses-across-remote-teams,How to manage business expenses across remote teams,"BlogHow to manage business expenses across remote teamsTilly Michell6 December 2021•3 minutesBusiness tipsFinanceIn this article•Remote working is on the rise•How to effectively track international employee expenses•Airwallex: A better way to manage international employee expenses•Why Airwallex is a smart solution for teams working remotelyRemote working is on the riseAs a trend, remote working was gaining momentum before the pandemic. Now, the era of virtually-connected staff working across borders is well and truly here, opening up exciting opportunities for companies when it comes to hiring talent, avoiding expensive office costs, and fostering a happy, healthy workforce.Kate Lister, the president of Global Workplace Analytics, saysthat she expects 70% the world’s workforce to be remote by 2025, which is great news for business owners and staff alike.Remote working is the ultimate two-way benefit. According to a study by Citrix and Harvard Business Review, 88% of knowledge workers say that when searching for a new position, they prioritise jobs that offer complete flexibility in their hours and location.What’s more, 83% predict that in response to the global talent shortage, companies will leverage flexible work models to reach out to suitable candidates around the world.How to effectively track international employee expenses1. Have a good expense-tracking system in placeThere are many pitfalls to avoid when managing international teams. A survey of C-suite executives led by McKinsey found that many believe remote working negatively impacts company culture. When people aren’t sharing the same office space—building trust over cups of coffee or post-work get-togethers—it’s harder to build company loyalty. This can spill over into areas like expense management, especially when expenses are filtered through a single company card. Employees in different time zones may find it harder to gain approval for necessary costs, and finance teams may struggle to track outgoings across borders, especially when accounting for multiple currencies. 2. Automate the employee expense process when you canIt’s important, when managing a fast-growing global team, to put systems in place that eliminate human error and inefficiency. Time-strapped CFOs can cause bottlenecks when signing off expenses, blocking workflows and causing frustration amongst employees. For this reason, a good employee expense solution should be quick, easy, and do as much of the work for you as possible.3. Eliminate unnecessary payment feesTraditional banks and credit card companies charge transaction fees for foreign currency expenses. These charges include a currency conversion fee which can be as much as 3.5% above the interbank rate, and a fixed purchase fee.  Cash withdrawals and online transactions in foreign currencies can come with similar costs.Airwallex: A better way to manage international employee expensesWith an Airwallex global account, companies can issue their international and domestic employees with borderless debit cards. These can be used anywhere that traditional debit cards are accepted, both in stores and online, and allow your team to pay in multiple currencies with zero transaction fees. Virtual employee cards can be created in minutes, and integrate seamlessly with Apple Pay and Google Pay. This means that every member of your team can have their own expense card and take it with them wherever they go. Expenses can be tracked from a single account, taking the stress out of managing employee costs across borders. It’s an effortless solution that is completely transparent. Why Airwallex is a smart solution for teams working remotelyNo transaction fees, no matter where or how the cards are used. Employees can spend in multiple currencies across borders.Managers can set spending limits at a card level, ensuring employees keep to budgets.Expenses can be tracked in real-time from a central account. Managers can create, freeze or cancel employee cards in minutes, freeing up bottlenecks and protecting your business’ funds.There’s no need for time-consuming expense claims, or for employees to wait to be reimbursed for money. So no one will be left out of pocket. Airwallex syncs hourly with Xero, making bookkeeping a breeze. There’s enough to worry about when growing a business that’s operating across borders without making employee expenses more complicated than they need to be. If you think Airwallex could be the right solution for you, apply for a free account online today, or click below to watch a 3 minute demo. Related article: The Benefits of Remote Work and Virtual TeamsBack to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-easiest-way-to-calculate-an-fx-rate,The easiest way to calculate an FX rate,"BlogThe easiest way to calculate an FX rate2 December 2021•5 minute readFinanceBusiness tipsIn this article•The challenges in calculating an FX rate•Finding and reading FX rates•The formula for how to calculate an FX rate•How are exchange rates determined?•How does inflation affect the exchange rate between two countries?•The bottom lineExchange rates are part and parcel of paying international clients, suppliers and employees. But calculating the relative value of one currency against another can be tricky business if you’re new to the game.
In this article, we’ll show you the simplest way to read and calculate an exchange rate. Wherever you are in the world, you can use this formula to know what a fair FX rate looks like and how to read the market to make an exchange at the right time.
The challenges in calculating an FX rateOne of the first things to be aware of is that the exchange rates are constantly changing. They fluctuate throughout the day depending on the rise and fall of the market and levels of demand. So any FX rate you might see in the morning may be gone by lunchtime.Another challenge you’ll face is that different providers may show different rates. Whether you’re using a foreign exchange provider or a bank, these suppliers typically won’t let you access the true exchange rate. Why? They’ve got to make a profit on it, so the rate you’ll get offered will usually come with a mark-up. Or, dare we say, additional fees?Finding and reading FX ratesThere are plenty of modern financial tools out there which you can use to read the true market FX rates. You’ve got money exchange websites and service providers, websites for the big banks. And, best of all, the rapidly growing crop of forex trading apps and platforms that offer real-time FX information.When reading these FX rates, you’re trying to determine what your local currency is worth in foreign currency. Meaning, you’re estimating what one unit of your currency is worth in another currency.It’s pretty straightforward to read FX rates. For example, if you see an exchange rate for AUD/GBP of 0.54, you’re essentially getting £0.54 for every AUD 1 that you convert to British Pounds.
The formula for how to calculate an FX rateThe formula for calculating an exchange rate is simple.Exchange rate = your starting figure (in your local currency) divided by the final amount (in the new currency)For example: Say you’re exchanging AUD 1,000 into USD. You receive USD 721 in return. Using the formula: 1,000 / 724 = 1.38. You can see the exchange rate is 1.38 AUD to 1 USD.Understanding the exchange rate is just as simple. All you need to do is divide your local currency figure by the FX number.Using the previous example: let’s say you see the exchange rate as 1.38 AUD to USD, and you’re looking to buy a new piece of office equipment for USD 724 with a budget of AUD 1,000.Divide your AUD by the exchange rate of 1.38, and you see that you’ve got USD 724 to spend (which, conveniently, is exactly what the equipment costs!).It’s quite a simplified way to look at it — but it works.
How are exchange rates determined?In Australia, we have what’s known as a floating exchange rate. This means that exchange rates aren’t set; they’re determined by the market of supply and demand for foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rate are caused by changes in local interest rates, international competition and the overall relative outlook of different world economies.With a floating exchange rate like this, you can expect to see more frequent, and more volatile, fluctuations between currencies.
How does inflation affect the exchange rate between two countries?Inflation is often closely linked to exchange rates and can have a big impact on potential FX rates. In theory, a reduction in the exchange rate can increase inflation. If your local currency reduces in value, the cost of imported goods and services increases too, driving up local prices and causing inflation. There’s usually quite a lag between movements in the exchange rate and their impacts on the local economy, so high inflation isn’t necessarily an immediate concern. But FX rate movements, on the other hand, happen all the time. That’s because the market itself is volatile, so you can expect to see differences in FX rates throughout the day.
The bottom lineIf you’re trying to understand how to calculate an exchange rate, it’s a massive money saver to arm yourself with as much information as you can get. Understanding how to calculate an FX rate can help businesses identify areas to reduce international spend and avoid inflated FX rates.There’s also an easier way to navigate FX rates. At Airwallex, we help you get the best exchange rate, every time. We’ve built our own foreign exchange engine which means you don’t have to go to the banks, or other money exchange channels, to calculate your rates.Put Airwallex to the test.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-the-founder-of-celle-skin-learned-from-launching-into-the-us,What the founder of Celle Skin learned from launching in the US,"BlogWhat the founder of Celle Skin learned from launching in the USShani Ishigaki30 November 2021•3 minutesCustomer storiesBusiness tipsIn this article•A red-hot business idea•Creating brand trust: the proof is in the pudding•One less thing to worry about — and 50,000 fewer dollars to find“I think I was once told you need to have a minimum of 50,000 US dollars in your bank account to have a US-dollar bank account.” – Vanessa Babuin, Founder and Managing Director at Celle SkinAt the root of it, Celle Skin’s vision was to create the world’s first wearable beauty product that could replace invasive cosmetic surgery and the “magic” cellulite creams that never seemed to work.
Thanks to Celle Skin’s innovative shapewear, and an equally-innovative global business account, Founder and Managing Director Vanessa is now helping women all over the world with their body woes.A red-hot business ideaWhen Vanessa originally pitched her hosiery range for curvy bodies, Sonsee Woman, on season one of Shark Tank Australia, business pioneer Naomi Simson knew she was onto something. So much so, Naomi invested AUD 80,000 for a 20% stake in the business.Naomi Simson recently caught up with Vanessa to talk about her latest launch into the US, including her journey from Shark Tank Australia contestant to a global success story. In this special Airwallex Customer Airtime episode, you’ll hear how Vanessa built an international brand that reached overseas markets with the help of Airwallex.Creating brand trust: the proof is in the puddingIt doesn’t matter how good your product is if your customers don’t trust you. Most people do their research before buying, which is why Vanessa developed a product that visibly reduced the signs of cellulite with fibres that promote healthy blood flow and circulation.But clinical evidence isn’t the only thing convincing customers to buy Celle Skin’s garments. Vanessa attributes brand trust and loyalty to the thousands of customer reviews she’s received so far. She says the results speak for themselves—which led Vanessa to believe that Celle Skin was a solid product-market fit for the US. One less thing to worry about — and 50,000 fewer dollars to findWhen Vanessa decided to take her brand offshore, she knew she’d face some challenges along the way. But she quickly learned that launching into the US market was a venture fraught with many more unexpected obstacles: the first being setting up a local bank account as a foreigner.“The challenges that came up were things that I didn’t think would be that difficult,” says Vanessa.“I think I was once told you need to have a minimum of 50,000 US dollars in your bank account to have a US-dollar bank account—which entrepreneurs and small businesses don’t really have sitting around,” she says.But Vanessa was able to bypass the banks, minimums and foreign exchange fees by opening up an Airwallex business account. Instead, Vanessa invested the money and her time and energy into launching her products.At the same time, it was important for Vanessa to keep track of all the different currencies, available funds and business transactions in one place.“The thing that I love most about Airwallex is that I can have a US-dollar account sitting there, I can have a Euro account which I pay my manufacturers in, and then I can also have all the cards associated with my different spend.”“I can open up my card and see all the transactions I use for Facebook in the US or my marketing team in the US.”All in all, Vanessa emphasises that Airwallex has helped her move to new markets with ease by streamlining her finances and eliminating the friction involved in an overseas launch. Geography and fees certainly won’t be holding her business back.Why not put Airwallex to the test?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-we-are-keeping-abreast-of-changes-in-the-world-of-economic-sanctions,How we are keeping abreast of changes in the world of economic sanctions,"BlogHow we are keeping abreast of changes in the world of economic sanctionsAmir Fadavi25 November 2021•7 minutesFinanceMost of us have probably heard the phrase “economic sanctions”. You may have heard it discussed in the news or perhaps when dealing with your bank or financial institution. Economic sanctions have been around for decades, and as more and more countries use them, their importance has increased. In particular, for those who conduct business internationally. As a global company licensed in several jurisdictions around the world, Airwallex must comply with different sets of economic sanctions, while staying committed to facilitating the global business of our clients. But what are economic sanctions? And why do they matter? What are economic sanctions? By definition, economic sanctions are a set of restrictive commercial and financial measures used by governments or international organisations (like the United Nations), to bring about changes in the behaviour of another government, entity, or person. Economic sanctions have become one of the favourite tools in a country’s foreign policy arsenal, and are used to apply pressure and drive desired changes in behaviour (of those against whom the sanctions are imposed). These restrictive measures can be very specific or very broad in nature. As an example, a specific economic sanction might block (freeze) all the assets of an organisation. While a broad restriction could be a complete ban on transactions related to a single country.Why do economic sanctions matter?  If that is confusing, you are not alone. While economic sanctions can be complex, they are also powerful tools with considerable business impacts. If a business chooses to disregard economic sanctions, it may be blacklisted or fined by the relevant authorities. This doesn’t just impact the business alone, but also its external stakeholders such as partners. International businesses need to respect not only the sanctions imposed by their operational location, but also those of their clients and the subsequent financial institutions they work with. What are ways to decrease the chance of sanctions violations as an international business? International businesses can take few steps to ensure they are not breaching economic sanctions: Knowing the customer - Many governments have put together lists of entities and individuals with whom one cannot deal with. By knowing who the customer is, an international business can check if doing business with it is prohibited or not.Staying informed about changes - Economic sanctions are fast changing and this should be taken into account by businesses. Something that might be permissible today, may be prohibited tomorrow. Therefore, it is important to keep abreast of developments in sanctions. Asking experts when in doubt - Economic sanctions are complex sets of rules and it’s easy to get them wrong. It is always helpful for a business to consult a subject matter expert when in doubt.  How does Airwallex manage economic sanctions globally?Our global legal and compliance team is dedicated to upholding regulations across all the regions we operate in. This includes economic sanctions. Such a complicated task is made possible thanks to a number of elements embedded in our Global Sanction Compliance Program. Airwallex management support - Airwallex is committed to fostering a culture of compliance throughout all areas of the business.

This is supported by a group of experts in different jurisdictions where Airwallex conducts business, ensuring we have the right local knowledge and expertise. Data-driven decision making approach - Unlike some conventional financial institutions, Airwallex uses data to make informed decisions about sanctions and restrictions. We manage the risk we face by looking at the data gathered through the course of business and we spot the risker areas. We also use our in-house technologies, as well as tools provided by our partners to ensure our clients do not use Airwallex for unauthorised activities.  Sharing the knowledge - A sanctions compliance program is only as strong as the shared-knowledge and team behind it. Airwallex’s compliance team trains employees on sanctions and makes them aware of our Sanctions Compliance Program. Within the compliance and legal teams, we ensure that all the recent developments are shared and that everyone is aware of the fast-changing regulator scene.  Not a check-in-the-box approach - At Airwallex, we work with clients of different sizes from various industries that are from different jurisdictions.

Thousands of UK businesses use Amazon as a launchpad for expanding their business abroad. If you’d like to join them, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we’ll outline how to set up a global Amazon seller account, how to make your product stand out to international customers, and how you can reduce the costs associated with selling products on Amazon across borders.  What are the benefits of selling internationally on Amazon?The short answer is: you can sell more stuff.According to Statistica, Amazon US net sales in 2020 totalled $263.52 billion, nearly 10 times greater than the UK, which pulled in a trifling $26.48 billion. Germany had the second highest net sales, with Japan coming in fourth behind the UK.With the help of Amazon, you may discover that your products enjoy greater popularity abroad than at home. The pushchair company, Bugaboo, is a prime example of this phenomenon. Bugaboo started life as a lowkey Dutch brand with limited penetration in the wider European market. It was only when their Frog buggy hit the US that sales exploded, and they became the chic buggy of choice for parents around the world.  How to set up an Amazon global seller accountBefore you start selling globally, you’ll need to set up an Amazon seller account. If you already have a seller account you can skip this part. Go to the Amazon seller page and choose the plan that’s right for you. Once you’ve signed up, you’ll be asked to provide some information about your business. You will also be required to submit proof of ID and may be asked for additional documents depending on where your business is based. Add your card details. This is so Amazon can pay you when customers buy your products, and charge you seller fees. Find out how you can reduce Amazon seller fees by using an Airwallex virtual debit card. Once you’ve provided all the necessary information, Amazon will verify your address by sending you a postcard with a unique code.It should take around two business days to become a fully verified Amazon seller. Once your seller account is up and running, you can register to sell in different countries by following these steps:Sign into Amazon Seller Central and select Global Selling from the Inventory dropdown menu.Click on the countries where you’d like to start selling, then click Register.Provide your details when prompted to complete the registration, and you’re done!You will now be able to manage your Amazon sales across different regions from a single linked account. How much does it cost to sell on Amazon?The downside of selling on Amazon is that merchants are subject to a smorgasbord of complicated fees. Amazon’s seller fees can be roughly broken down into seven categories.Account fees: a flat fee of £25 per month if you have a Professional plan, or a fee of £0.75 per item sold if you have an Individual plan.Referral fees: a percentage of the amount your customers pay you, this varies from 5 - 45% depending on the type of products you sell and their value.Fulfilment fees: you can choose to store and ship products yourself, or you can use Fulfilment By Amazon (FBA). Either way, Amazon charges a fee. Refund administration fees: 20% of the original order up to a maximum of £5Closing fees: this applies to media items like video games, books and software. The fee is £1 for books and £0.50 for other media.High volume listing fees: if you list more than 2 million SKUs in a given month, you will be charged a fee of £0.0003 per SKU. This does not apply to media items.International seller fees: these include additional fulfilment charges and currency conversion fees.  Categories 1 - 6 apply whether you’re selling domestically or internationally. But when you sell products across borders in different currencies, you will be subject to additional charges. What are the additional costs for selling on Amazon globally?Amazon Pay multi-currency allows merchants to sell products around the world in a variety of local currencies. However, if your Amazon account is linked to a UK bank account, you will be charged additional fees when international customers buy your products. These include:Cross-border fees: between 0.4% - 1.5% depending on the country where you’re selling.Authorisation fee: £0.30 per transaction.Processing fee: 2.7%Currency conversion fee: 2.5%Fortunately, there is a way you can get around these additional costs, that’s where Airwallex comes in. How to reduce international Amazon Pay fees with AirwallexIf your Amazon account is linked to a UK bank account, you will have to pay a currency conversion fee and a cross-border fee when accepting payments from international customers in foreign currencies. To get around these fees, you have two choices:1. Set up a local bank account in each location where you sellSay you’re a UK business that sells on Amazon US. You can open a local US bank account and connect it to your Amazon US seller account. By funnelling US sales revenue into this account, you can avoid Amazon’s cross-border and currency conversion fees. The drawback here is that banks also charge high currency conversion and transfer fees. That means when it comes to sending your money back to the UK, you could be charged up to 3.5% above the interbank rate plus a transfer fee. A big dent in your profit margin! Luckily, there is another option. 
2. Open a global business account with AirwallexWith an Airwallex Global Account, you can collect multiple currencies—including USD, Euros, Pound Sterling and Hong Kong Dollars—from your Amazon account into a single business bank account, with zero transfer fees or forced currency conversions. When it comes to currency exchange, we charge just 0.5 - 1% above the interbank rate, considerably cheaper than both Amazon Pay, which charges 2.5% above the wholesale exchange rate, and high street banks, which charge between 2 - 3.5% above the interbank exchange rate.Depending on the volume of your international sales, you could add thousands of pounds back into your bottom line using this workaround. You’ll also have the convenience of managing your money from a central account, rather than dealing with several foreign bank accounts. You can compare Airwallex against other business accounts here or sign up for a free account to learn more.  How to fulfil your products abroadOnce you’ve worked out how you’re going to collect money from your international customers, you need to decide how you’re going to get your products into their hands. There are three steps involved:Importing your products: if you’re dealing with large volumes, it makes sense to import your products in bulk rather than posting individual items to international customers. This will reduce delivery times and costs. To get your products through customs, you must have the right paperwork, so choose a freight company or customs broker you can trust. 
Storing your products: your chosen freight company may also offer storage facilities, but it pays to shop around for a trustworthy storage unit that doesn’t cost the earth. 
 Packing and sending your products: Amazon requires that products are packed and shipped to a certain standard. You must ensure your packing company meets these standards to avoid incurring a fine. You should also check that your fulfilment company has a smooth returns process. If you want peace of mind, Fulfilment By Amazon (FBA) will take care of all three steps for you. By choosing FBA, you can rest assured that your products will be stored and packed to Amazon standards, and your returns process will be taken care of. Businesses who use FBA may also be eligible for Amazon Prime Free Two Day Shipping, which can dramatically boost your ranking and sales on Amazon.  How to improve global sales on Amazon You’ve set up your Amazon international seller account, you’ve linked it to a multi-currency business account, and you’re ready to take your company global. Here’s how to make sure your venture is a roaring success.1. Don’t rely on Google TranslateAmazon’s online store operates a bit like a search engine, so it’s important that you use the right keywords on your product pages. These keywords may differ by region, even in English-speaking countries— for example, in the US trainers are called sneakers, in Australia flip-flops are called thongs. To make sure you’re getting your keywords right, look at the language your competitors use on international Amazon pages. You can also use Google Trends to research the terms customers use when searching for your products around the world.If you’re selling in non-English-speaking countries, ask someone who is fluent in the local language to translate your product pages. Nothing breaks customer trust like a badly written product description, so don’t just use Google Translate! 
2. Provide regional customer support Amazon requires merchants to provide customer support in the local language of each country where they sell. You can either hire a regional customer service team or, if you’re using FBA, Amazon will take care of this for you.
3. Take note of local holidays Christmas and Black Friday are important shopping periods in the west. But elsewhere these holidays pass by without much note. Across Asia, Single’s Day is the biggest event in the ecommerce calendar. Whilst in Japan, online sales peak during Golden Week in late April. Use our global ecommerce calendar to ensure you don’t miss any important international holidays.
4. Get reviews, and lots of themReviews play a big part in both search ranking and sales conversion on Amazon. Whilst your UK reviews will show up on international pages, they will not be featured in the main review section, and will therefore carry less weight.To make sure you rack up some local reviews, you can lean on Amazon’s Early Reviewer incentivisation program. You can also use an automated tool to encourage customers to review your products. Final thoughtsIf you want to take your business global, but feel overwhelmed by the logistics, Amazon can provide you with an easy inroad into international selling. As well as helping you reach millions of online shoppers worldwide, Amazon’s fulfillment services remove many of the blockers that can make global trading a headache for smaller businesses. As long as there’s a market for your products abroad, and you’re able to make a decent profit margin when accounting for Amazon’s fees, you can use the world’s largest ecommerce site to probe new markets and grow your brand without borders. Related article: How to Sell on Amazon US from AustraliaBack to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

You just got engaged and are getting a puppy - congrats on both fronts! How do you feel? Thanks a lot - it’s been a whirlwind over the past few weeks! We’re feeling really excited and positive about all the upcoming preparation (both wedding and puppy-related), and know it’ll be a lot of work too. For the engagement, it was tough keeping it a secret, since I had both our parents fly out and have to drive all the way into wine country, but it worked out well, where friends and family were able to attend live, both in-person and over Zoom. As for the puppy, we just picked up little Potato from a small ranch in Idaho. He’s currently 12 weeks old and starting to get comfortable in his new home. His favorite thing to do is pick up sticks on walks and sleeping on his back. Everyone meet Potato - he’s 12 weeks old and was born in IdahoPrior to Airwallex, you worked in the finance department at Uber. Tell us about the experience and what draws you to high-growth startups?Working at high-growth startups has been an unbelievable experience, and one of the bucket list career items I’ve been able to check off. Working at Uber, there were definitely some late nights and moments of head scratching in the lead up to their IPO, but I’m really grateful I was a part of it. I’m starting to see a lot of similarities between early-Uber and where Airwallex is headed - this gives me a lot of hope for the future. What has really attracted me to these types of companies is the ability to make an impact on day one. The work you do has a profound impact on the product, processes, and people rather than feeling like a proverbial cog in the wheel. You were employee number three in the US. How has your role changed?That’s a technicality (Bryant and I started together)! But working with him, Toshi and Carol for the first few months were some of the most memorable moments at Airwallex, especially working out of a 4-person WeWork office where we had to lock the door any time one of us stepped out. What’s been really interesting about the role is that I was hired in “Strategy and Operations,” which meant that it could support anything and everything, depending on what the business needs at the time. In the early days, that meant cold-emailing banks and customer outreach, creating product marketing materials, funds flows, and fielding Zendesk support tickets! Nowadays we’ve hired a great team to make those areas much better, and so a lot of my focus is spent on the platform side working on customer onboarding and sales operations. While the roles have changed quite a bit, I would say that it all still falls under what I was hired to do. That’s always been the exciting part about being at Airwallex!Word is you have a pretty impressive airline miles / points collection. What’s the craziest trip you’ve taken to increase your mileage? It’s become a bit of a side hobby/hustle as I’m always trying to find creative ways to accrue more points and miles or retain my status even without flying as much the past several years. The craziest one that comes to mind is when I was still in consulting and needed about 40,000 more miles for the rest of the year. It was late October, I had just rolled off my project and did not have any travel scheduled for the rest of the year. I took three trips over three weeks: one to Hong Kong for two days, one to Hawaii for one day, and another one to Hawaii where I got to Honolulu and turned back on the next flight out (lucky for me I was able to buy some Dole pineapples at the airport).Our flight back from Vietnam was made a little bit better thanks to this mealIt takes time and persistence to penetrate a new market. Based on your conversations, how have North American customers responded to our solution? What unique challenges are we solving? We’ve hired a great U.S. team that’s been able to articulate the breadth of our products to some of the largest enterprises in the world. Though each customer is trying to solve for a slightly different use case, we are truly providing a unique product with scale and giving these companies the ability to white-label their own payments platform. We are arming them with the tools they need in order to customize the whole experience for their customers and allow them to control that narrative. Giving these platforms the choice between a fully native payments experience or a lighter branding (particularly for those with fewer dev resources) allows us to cast a wider net on the types of companies we target, and I believe we’ll be able to do this better than any of our competitors.What advice would you give to those working at a high-growth startup?For the sake of word count, I’ll keep it to the point. Start each day with the intention to be adaptable in a changing environment, be organized with your workload, and practice patience (particularly when dealing with customers!).Looking to take the next step in your career?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-make-your-google-ads-budget-stretch-further,How to make your Google Ads budget stretch further,"BlogHow to make your Google Ads budget stretch furtherTilly Michell23 November 2021•3 minutesBusiness tipsWhen you start investing in Google Ads, the costs may come as a bit of shock. Google can easily gobble up a few thousand pounds of budget before generating any leads, and unless you know some tricks to help your budget stretch further, CFOs might be tempted to turn the money tap off.  However, whilst watching your budget trickle away can be alarming, turning off your ads sporadically is not a good strategy. Google learns by trial and error. The longer your campaigns run, the more data will be collected and the better your conversion rates will be. When you switch off your ads, Google’s machine learning resets, and you have to start from scratch. A much better strategy is to keep your adverts running but take steps to incrementally reduce your cost per acquisition.  Google calculates the average ROI for adverts at 200%. So if you stick at it, you should eventually start to see results from your campaigns. Here are 14 ways you can reduce spend and increase conversion on your Google Ads. 
1. Use phrase match and exact match keywords Bidding on competitive search terms is expensive, especially if you're using Google’s default keyword setting—broad match.  If your budgets are tight and your conversion rates aren't where you want them to be, reduce your broad match keywords and replace them with phrase match and exact match options.   For example, if you’re a vegan ice cream company, changing ‘vegan ice cream’ to an exact match rather than a broad match term will prevent Google serving your ads to dairy-lovers. Whilst using phrase matches such as: ‘vegan ice cream home delivery’ or ‘dairy-free ice cream wedding’, will help you target specific audience profiles.  2. Turn off poor-performing keywordsScrutanise your Google ads report daily. If a keyword is generating a high number of expensive clicks but few conversions, turn it off. Your budget is better spent on more targeted keywords.  3. Add negative keywordsNegative keywords prevent the wrong customers clicking on your ads.For example, if your company sells window shades, you don’t want people clicking on your ads whilst shopping for lamp shades. To fix this issue you can add ‘lamp’ as a negative keyword.Continue adding negative keywords as your campaign progresses. Look in your search terms report for irrelevant terms that are generating clicks on your ads but no conversions, and add these as negative keywords. 4. Use Dynamic Search AdsDynamic Search Ads use text and images from your website to automatically build adverts that match customer searches. They also link customers directly to your most relevant landing pages, reducing the steps in your customer journey. For example, if your business sells homeware, Dynamic Search Ads will target customers who search ‘salad bowl’ with a headline and image from your website, such as ‘Green Ceramic Salad Bowl’. When a customer clicks the advert, they will be taken directly to the landing page where they can buy the bowl. Dynamic Search Ads are particularly useful for businesses that sell multiple products. According to Google, they can decrease cost per conversion by as much as 37%. 5. Adjust bids by deviceIf your click-through rate on mobile is high, but your conversion rate is poor, you can reduce your bid rate on mobile and increase it on higher performing devices, such as desktop.  In this instance, it’s worth asking yourself why customers aren’t converting on certain devices. Are your landing pages not optimised for mobile? Or is it just that your purchase journey is better suited to a larger screen? Regardless, it’s best to ensure your mobile experience is as good as it can be, no matter the industry.6. Adjust bids by location  Isolate the geographies where your ads perform best—perhaps your CPAs are high in Leeds but low in New York. Increase your bids for the locations where your ads are converting and decrease them for underperforming locations. Doing this will ensure you get more impressions in areas where your conversion rates are high. 7. Use automated biddingWith automated bidding, Google’s algorithms adjust your bids based on your campaign objectives. There are eight types of automated bidding strategy to choose from. To maximise conversions whilst minimising ad spend, the best strategies are:Enhanced CPCMaximise ConversionsMaximise Conversion ValueTarget Cost Per ActionTarget Return on Ad Spend Used together, these strategies are referred to as ‘Smart Bidding’. Smart Bidding takes the guesswork out of campaign management, helping you get the most out of your budget. Smart Bidding is generally more effective than manual bidding, but to keep costs down you must use these strategies in tandem. For example, when using the Maximise Conversions strategy, set a daily target ad spend for each campaign, and a target cost per action. You can adjust these targets as the campaign progresses to ensure you’re keeping CPAs as low as possible, whilst increasing conversions. 8. Use Smart Display CampaignsSmart Display Campaigns use a combination of automated bidding, automated targeting and automated ad creation to optimise your display ads.You provide Google with a mix of headlines, images, videos and logos, and Google learns the combinations that work best for each target audience. Smart Display uses machine learning to ensure your display adverts reach the right audience with the most effective message.  9. Set your display ads to Pay for ConversionsIf your Google Ads account has more than 100 conversions in the past 30 days, you may be eligible to switch your display campaign to Pay for Conversions. Doing so will mean you only pay when your customers transact, rather than paying for clicks or impressions. Google has strict criteria when it comes to Pay for Conversions, because they don’t want to lose money on low-performing ads. If you’re eligible, you’ll see an option to pay by conversion when you reach the ‘bidding’ section when setting up your display campaign. Before selecting this option, make sure you’ve set your target CPA at a reasonable rate. Although it’s tempting to set your target CPA at a much lower rate than normal, doing so could mean your impressions take a nosedive. 10. Eliminate unnecessary payment fees Not many people know this, but because Google ads are billed in Ireland, traditional banks charge a currency conversion fee when you pay by bank transfer. To avoid these fees, you can pay for your ads via a virtual debit card. There are also costs associated with paying for ads in non-GBP currencies when your business is registered in the UK. To avoid these fees, it’s best to set up a multi-currency business account.  11. Reduce friction on landing pagesPPC advertising is a game of two halves. The first challenge is to encourage the right customers to click on your ads, the second is to convert them. To improve conversion, optimise your landing pages on both mobile and desktop devices. You can achieve this by running split tests on Google to refine your messaging and layout. If you’re targeting international customers, you can significantly improve conversion by allowing them to pay in their local currency. Airwallex integrates with online payment platforms (including Magento and Woocommerce) enabling your customers to pay in their currency of choice. Our transaction rates are market-beating, and our global accounts help you swerve currency conversion charges.  12. Use geo-ads customisationAs well as adjusting your bids, you can also adjust your ad copy by location. This is useful if you offer benefits such as free shipping to some areas but not others. If your ad copy is price-led, you should use the correct currency for each country.  13. Optimise ad copyAs with keyword targeting, it pays to make your ad copy specific. You don’t want people clicking on your adverts only to find you don’t have what they’re looking for. Pull out keywords where relevant into their own ad groups and write purpose-built copy in order to capitalise on this demand. 

For copy inspiration, look at the keywords that your site already ranks for, and study your competitors’ ad copy. You can also use Google’s Smart Creative solutions to test the copy that works best. 14. Adjust your customer journey  Customers might not be ready to part with their money when they first hit your site, but that doesn't mean they won’t buy from you in future. To keep them in your sales cycle, try offering a softer option such as a free trial, a webinar or some free content. Put your freebies behind a data wall, capture leads and nurture them into paying customers.   Final thoughtsGoogle Ads take some time and upfront investment before they deliver ROI. But within a few months, you should start to see your CPAs drop as your conversion rates increase. These strategies are the best way to ensure you’re optimising your campaigns, targeting the right audience and squeezing the most out of your budget.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-is-a-telegraphic-transfer,What is a telegraphic transfer?,"BlogWhat is a telegraphic transfer?Tilly Michell22 November 2021•4 minutesBusiness tipsTechnologyIn this article•How do telegraphic transfers work?•How do you send money via telegraphic transfer?•What are the fees associated with telegraphic transfer?•Airwallex offers a cheaper, faster type of international paymentSending and receiving money overseas is a crucial part of any modern business. It’s worth understanding the pros and cons of different methods to ensure you’re not throwing money away.If you’re already handling money in multiple currencies, sending it across borders or even making a domestic payment, it’s likely you’ve already used a telegraphic transfer without ever hearing its old-fashioned name.Also known as a telex transfer, a TT or a TT bank payment, this electronic transfer method is used to wire money both domestically and abroad. Because they are so ubiquitous, and often used to send money across borders, TTs are often referred to generically as wire transfers, overseas transfers or electronic fund transfers.Although they are still used in digital form today, the idea behind telegraphic transfers has a long history. Telegrams and telex messages were the original text messages, sent electronically and then passed to the reader in physical form. In previous centuries, banks would use these systems to communicate and arrange a bank transfer.Although the telegraph itself is now obsolete, this was the foundation for the system we have today. Now, funds are transferred electronically via secure cloud-based apps or cables connecting banks, but the name remains. How do telegraphic transfers work?When you send a telegraphic transfer, the payment passes through several networked banks to reach its destination. In the UK, one type of telegraphic transfer uses a network called the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS). CHAPS payments are typically carried out on the same day, for high-value or time-critical transactions.The other common type of UK money transfer system, BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing Services) payments, are not types of telegraphic transfer. It is a common misconception that they come under this umbrella.Internationally, money can be transferred by telegraphic transfer via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). For this reason, the terms telegraphic transfer and SWIFT transfer are sometimes used synonymously. SWIFT was launched in 1973 to make it easier to send money overseas, standardising the system to make it quicker and less error-prone. How do you send money via telegraphic transfer?To dispatch money via telegraphic transfer, the sender needs the account numbers and routing numbers of the recipient, as well as their financial institution.If you’re sending money internationally, you may also need the recipient’s IBAN number or SWIFT code. These help ensure that the funds arrive in the correct bank account.Personally identifiable information is also required for security purposes and to confirm the identity of the sender.Most financial institutions will allow users to send telegraphic transfers by logging into their online banking account and doing it directly. If you are sending money abroad, search for the sections marked with words such as “international payment,” or “wire transfer”.What are the fees associated with telegraphic transfer?The cost of a telegraphic transfer varies depending on the financial institutions involved and the amount of money being transferred. Each bank that the funds pass through has its own fees and processing times. In total, you can expect to pay between £15 - £25 for a telegraphic transfer. That’s on top of exchange rates, which can be as high as 3.5% above the interbank rate if you use a high street bank to make the transfer.Telegraphic transfer fees are often so opaque that senders aren’t aware of the full costs until the transfer is complete. Compared to other electronic payment methods, telegraphic transfers are fairly expensive, but the tradeoff is that they happen relatively fast. Usually the payments are received within one or two days. Airwallex offers a cheaper, faster type of international paymentTT payments may no longer require sending telegrams, but they are still based on a centuries-old system. Luckily, traditional financial institutions are no longer the only option when it comes to sending money overseas.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-import-goods-to-the-uk-your-ultimate-guide,How to import goods to the UK: Your ultimate guide,"BlogHow to import goods to the UK: Your ultimate guideTilly Michell22 November 2021•5 mintuesBusiness tipsIn this article•Choose an ethical supplier•Pay your suppliers, without paying the banks  •Secure a customs broker and freight forwarder•Decide how you’re going to transport your goods•Get your paperwork in order•Final thoughtsIf you’re a UK-based business that sells physical products, there’s a high chance you import goods from international suppliers.According to eMarketer, the UK represents the third largest ecommerce market in the world. But Britain’s manufacturing output remains relatively small, accounting for just 1.8% of global production. In other words, we sell a lot of stuff that other people make. Importing goods to the UK can be complicated, and is not without risks. Unless you know your stuff, you could make errors that damage your brand and hurt your bottom line. In this article we’ll provide a step-by-step guide to importing goods into the UK. Whether you’re launching a new venture, or have been running your business for years, this guide will help you save money, build customer loyalty, and establish a trusting relationship with your international suppliers.  Choose an ethical supplierFirst thing’s first. Before deciding to work with an international supplier, you must do your research. Over the past few years, several brands have faced accusations of exploitation from factory workers. Not all countries have the same regulations when it comes to working conditions, so you must take personal responsibility for how your products are made when working with overseas suppliers. For advice on sourcing ethical suppliers, join a business network such Common Objective or the Institute of Business Ethics. You can also consult other business owners by visiting trade shows and joining online forums such as the Shopify Entrepreneurs Facebook group. Many businesses now put sustainability and ethics at the heart of their brand identity, and list the factories they work with on their website and product pages. This transparency can help you build trust with customers, and gain an edge over less scrupulous competitors.Pay your suppliers, without paying the banks  Paying overseas suppliers means transferring big chunks of money abroad. If you transfer money using a high street bank, you will be subject to exchange rates of up to 3.5% above the interbank rate. That means if you’re paying an international supplier £100,000 in their local currency, you could end up giving the bank a whopping £3,500 just for the privilege of sending money abroad. To avoid these fees, you have two options:1. Use a cheaper method for transferring money Airwallex offers a market-beating currency exchange rate of just 0.5 - 1% above the interbank rate. Open a global account with us, and you’ll pay significantly less when sending money abroad. 2. Avoid currency exchange altogetherThe benefit of a foreign currency account is that you can receive, hold and send multiple currencies without making unnecessary currency conversions. Say you’re a UK business with a large customer base in Europe, and you also have European suppliers. You can collect Euros from your customers straight into your global account, keep them there for as long as you want, then use them to pay your European suppliers when the time comes. This way you can sidestep currency exchange fees altogether. Hundreds of businesses use Airwallex to avoid unnecessary conversion fees and add thousands of pounds back into their bottom line. If you’d like to join them, apply to open a free global business account today. Secure a customs broker and freight forwarderWe highly recommend that you secure a customs broker to help get your products across the UK border. Customs brokers are fully versed in international trade law, and will ensure your goods arrive the in the UK without a hitch. Many freight companies, including DHL and Fedex, offer customs brokerage as part of their service. If your chosen freight forwarder doesn’t offer customs clearance services, you can hire a broker separately. To secure the best deal, you should get an itemised quote from several providers before choosing who to go with. Decide how you’re going to transport your goodsAs a general rule, if you’re importing goods from outside Europe, your cheapest option is to ship by sea. Air freight is around six times more expensive than sea freight, and should only be used if you need products delivered fast, or if your items are extremely small and lightweight.   If you’re importing from Europe, you can transport goods via road or rail relatively cheaply. But bear in mind that a shortage of lorry drivers in the UK has caused delays in recent months. Get your paperwork in orderBefore you import goods to the UK, you must have all the necessary paperwork in place. If you employ a customs broker, they will work with you to ensure the following steps are completed correctly. 1. Get an EORI numberYour business needs an Economic Operators Registration and Identification number (EORI) in order to make a customs declaration. You can apply for an EORI number on the government website. 2. Find the commodity code for your goodsCommodity codes are a ten digit number used by customs to classify products entering the UK. They determine the duties and taxes that you’ll have to pay on your imports. Commodity codes used to apply to imports from outside the EU only, but due to Brexit EU imports now also require a code. If you do not use the correct code your goods may be held by customs, costing you time and money. Use this tool to find out which codes apply to your products. 3. Find out if your goods need an import licence or certificateThis applies to controlled goods such as plants, medicines and chemicals. 4. Determine the value of your goodsThe amount of VAT you pay depends on the value of the goods you are importing. You must include this value on your import declaration. There are several ways to establish the value of your goods. One method is to provide evidence of the price you paid for them (including commission, packing, shipping and insurance costs), another is to provide evidence of the manufacturing costs.  5. Establish Incoterms with your supplierIncoterms, or International Commercial Terms, are a set of globally recognised guidelines which determine who is accountable for your products throughout their shipping journey. You must agree your Incoterms with your supplier before products are shipped, so that it’s clear at which point responsibilities—such as insurance, taxes and customs procedures—shift from your supplier to you. Incoterms are set out by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The current guidelines were written in 2020 and can be downloaded from the ICC website. You must include your Incoterms on your commercial invoice.   6. Ensure your supplier has their paperwork in orderYour supplier must have the necessary licences and certifications to send goods to the UK, and may need to make an export declaration in their country. 6. Establish whether you can reduce or eliminate customs duty on your importsIf the UK has a trade agreement with the country you’re importing from, or if they’re covered under the UK Generalised Scheme of Preference, you may be able to reduce your customs duty or avoid paying duties altogether. You can also reduce your customs duty if you are importing goods temporarily, re-importing goods that have been imported before, or importing goods to repair them. Learn more about whether your goods are exempt from customs duty here.6. Find out if you can delay customs payments and declarationsThe UK government introduced a delayed customs scheme to soften the impact of Brexit. However, this scheme is due to end on 31st December 2021. Use this tool to find out whether you can delay customs payments and declarations up to six months after the import date.7. Make an import declaration and get your goods cleared by customsAs mentioned, we recommend that you use a customs broker to help you with your import declaration. Customs brokers understand how import laws apply across different products and countries, and can help you get your goods through customs efficiently. For ease, you can choose a freight company which includes customs brokerage as part of their service. If you’re not using a customs broker, you’ll need to submit an import declaration yourself, and pay what you owe in tax and duties before you get your goods through customs. Use this step-by-step guide to making an import declaration from HMRC.Final thoughtsImporting goods into the UK requires research and attention to detail. With the right support in place, you can avoid unnecessary fees and ensure your products pass through customs smoothly.By dedicating time to finding a good supplier, freight forwarder and money transfer service, you can save money and protect your business in the long term.  To learn more about how Airwallex can help you save thousands on global money transfers, sign up for a free account or book a demo today.   Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/4-habits-of-highly-successful-ecommerce-businesses,4 Habits of highly successful eCommerce businesses,"Blog4 Habits of highly successful eCommerce businessesShani Ishigaki18 November 2021•7 minutesE-commerceBusiness tipsWhen most people look to successful eCommerce businesses for inspiration, they tend to focus on the products, the packaging and the ads.But here’s the truth: products and marketing are merely part of the puzzle when it comes to these success stories. There are so many other elements at play, and ignoring the winning formula is a big mistake.The secret to building a successful eCommerce businessWhen we spoke to eCommerce founders about the strategies that helped build their own successful brands, we learned that their real power is their ability to lead purpose-led, customer-centric and experience-driven growth strategies.With some of the biggest days on the eCommerce calendar finally behind us, it’s a good time to take guidance from the brands that showed up on game day.In this article, we’ll share four valuable ideas to help brands reach more customers, not just on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but well into 2022.
1. They get customers talking about their brand valuesWhen you see customers declaring their love for a brand on social media, it’s not always their product or service people are talking about.In many cases, it’s their brand values that lead to real engagement and close customer connections. They know what they stand for and what resonates with their target market.Finding the ‘why’ of your brandFounder of sustainable bedding and sleepwear label Ettitude, Phoebe Yu, says it’s not enough to simply create a great product and call it a day. “These days, the smart consumers also buy into the ‘why’ of the brand or company,” says Phoebe.With so many sustainable bedding brands available in the market, the company put a laser focus on what they stood for as a business and their brand as a whole entity.After years of working in the textile and homewares industry, Phoebe leveraged her 
first-hand experience to create something more sustainable, more comfortable and more affordable. “People want more sustainable products, but I don’t think we should pay more,” Phoebe says.It’s easy to get sidetracked by what your competitors are doing or what the latest trends are when you’re building a business. But if you offer customers something they can relate to, it’s much easier to gather momentum. Never underestimate the power of word-of-mouth marketing.
2. They get personal with products and the customer experiencePersonalisation is a hot trend among eCommerce businesses.It’s no surprise. Recent customer experience research from McKinsey found that 80% of shoppers want personalisation.As customer preferences shift, newcomers are outmanoeuvring established brands by offering personalised products and tailored customer experiences.The bar has never been higher for eCommerce, but small businesses now have access to the digital tools they need to challenge the bigger players.Customisation takes the cakeTake Lyka, for example, a direct-to-consumer fresh pet food company that’s disrupting an industry that hasn’t seen innovation in decades. Their online-only business model lets pet owners customise recipes, meal plans and portions, depending on their pet’s breed, age, activity level and allergies.Reducing the cognitive loadFurniture company Brosa’s Chief Commercial Officer Rushabh Sanghavi says personalisation throughout the buyer journey has been a key differentiating factor for the brand. Infrequently purchased products like furniture require a unique selling proposition to keep new business flowing through. But Rushabh says they’ve achieved this by reducing the cognitive load of buying furniture. How? By offering easy delivery, at-home assembly and services to have customers' packaging materials collected and recycled.“The [furniture] industry isn’t known for its great customer experience, and that’s something we truly believe we are disrupting at all stages of the purchase journey for the customer—be it when they walk into our store or interact with our teams online over chat,” Rushabh says.“We’re going over and above at all times to make it easy and simple for them to put their homes together.”
3. They don’t just stick to tried-and-tested marketing channelsEvery business owner is looking for the marketing channel that delivers the best quality leads at the lowest cost. And prioritising channels that make the most sense to your business—for the most part—is smart. It helps keep your cost-per-acquisition (CPA) down.But that doesn’t mean you should put all your advertising eggs in one digital basket.Successful entrepreneur Phoebe Yu (Ettitude) recommends always reserving at least 15% of your marketing budget for experimental channels. Aside from the potential pay-off, there are a couple of benefits to this approach.
Brand trust takes timeToday’s technology has changed online marketing, our lives and our businesses. A customer can come to you at any given moment for a variety of reasons. It’s not a linear journey from awareness to consideration to brand loyalty.Think about the last time you made an online purchase. Odds are it wasn’t the first time you interacted with that brand, or the first channel, or even the one device. A multi-touch marketing approach can help you reach customers at different stages in the buying cycle. The same is true for the reverse scenario where you only reach so many customers through a single marketing channel. If the net you cast is only so wide, your business growth will eventually stagnate.
Customer expectations aren’t uniformBeing customer-obsessed isn’t about having a sixth sense. It’s about being flexible enough to let customers choose their own path to purchase.As Naomi Simson, Founder of RedBalloon, said in a recent webinar ‘How to win & retain customers for your biggest Q4 ever’, business leaders need to understand that customers are in the driver’s seat.“People come to your brand at any given point for a variety of reasons, and there are three primary ones,” Naomi says.Understanding that each customer journey is unique will allow you to capture interest when and where it counts.
4. They go where the demand is…even if it’s abroadUp until recently, dreams of international expansion and global growth for businesses used to be just that: dreams.Even with the rise of eCommerce, businesses were forced to choose between two less-than-ideal options:Use a payment gateway and cop the crippling foreign exchange fees.Wait months on end to set up local bank accounts with overseas branches (and still pay the high FX rates).Yes, taking the leap offshore used to be a perilous pursuit. But the world is becoming increasingly connected, and eCommerce businesses are starting to offer their products and services wherever they’re wanted.From growing pains to global growthAccording to Shopify, the global eCommerce market is worth a total of $4.89 trillion in 2021. That figure is expected to grow over the next few years, which tells us that borderless eCommerce is quickly becoming the norm.In fact, a recent Airwallex poll found that 77% of small and medium-sized businesses in the UK planned to expand their international presence in 2022.Thanks to modern global business accounts, multi-currency wallets and payments technology disruptors, businesses can now turn their growing pains into global growth. Customers all over the world can now buy from the brands they love without paying a penalty.
Final thoughtsMany eCommerce owners make the mistake of trying to emulate their competitors without truly understanding why their business is successful.If you take one thing away from this article, remember that every business is unique. Figure out your purpose, be customer-obsessed and create experiences that set you apart. If you can do these things, you’re way ahead of the curve and on track for success.What strategies have (or haven’t) helped your business in the past?Back to blogShareShani IshigakiContent Marketing ManagerWriter, content strategist and storyteller.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/whats-the-best-way-to-transfer-money-abroad-from-the-uk,What’s the best way to transfer money abroad from the UK?,"BlogWhat’s the best way to transfer money abroad from the UK?Tilly Michell17 November 2021•4 minutesFinanceBusiness tipsIn this article•How international bank transfers work •How to bypass the SWIFT network and send money globally with zero transfer fees•How to get the cheapest currency exchange rate•How to avoid currency exchange fees•How long will international money transfers take to clear?   •Transfer money abroad faster and cheaper with AirwallexPaying suppliers and staff across borders can incur hefty transfer and exchange fees unless you do your research. As companies move towards a borderless future, business owners are looking for better ways to transfer money abroad. You might be tempted to use a high street bank when making a global money transfer, simply because you’ve banked with them for years. But the Big 4 actually offer some of the least competitive rates on international transfers, with transaction fees of up to £25 per transfer, and exchange rates that can reach 3.5% above the interbank rate. That means if you pay your US suppliers $100k per year, you could end up forking out over £3,500 to the banks, just for the privilege of sending money abroad!  There are cheaper ways to transfer money across borders, and even swerve currency exchange fees altogether. Read on to find out more. How international bank transfers work Since the 1970s, banks have used the SWIFT network to transfer money between countries. SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. It’s a system that allows banks to communicate financial information with one another.  When you transfer money via the SWIFT network, your bank will send a message to the recipient’s bank. If the recipient’s bank is not part of the SWIFT network, and your bank doesn’t have a direct relationship with them, the message will go via an intermediary bank. This process can take up to five business days, and each bank will charge a handling fee, which is why SWIFT transfers are so expensive. Banks usually charge between £15 - £25 for SWIFT transfers, that’s on top of exchange rates, which can be up to 3.5% above the interbank rate.  How to bypass the SWIFT network and send money globally with zero transfer feesSWIFT was revolutionary for its time, but it’s now around 50 years old. It’s outdated, expensive, and lacks transparency, leading modern businesses to search for an alternative solution.  Fintechs like Airwallex have developed systems that allow you to bypass the SWIFT network and send money abroad with zero fees. This is done using a network of local bank accounts and payment routes, which enable businesses to receive and send money around the world in multiple currencies without bureaucracy or associated fees.  Airwallex allows businesses to receive, hold and send money in 11+ currencies—including USD, AUD, GBP, Euros and Hong Kong Dollars—quickly and easily with zero transfer fees. How to get the cheapest currency exchange rateIn addition to transfer fees, businesses need to consider currency exchange when sending money internationally.  How much you pay for currency exchange depends on which provider you use to transfer your money. UK high street banks charge between 2.6 - 3.5% above the interbank rate. Which, when you’re making big money transfers, is a sizable wad of cash that will quickly eat into your profit margins  Here again, it pays to shop around. Airwallex charges a more favourable 0.5 - 1% above the interbank rate for currency exchange.   Aside from choosing the right provider to transfer your money, getting the best deal on your currency exchange depends on when you make the transfer. Currency values are in constant flux, and change second by second depending on a range of political and economic factors. To protect against currency fluctuations, some providers allow you to lock in exchange rates for a period of time. So you can be sure you’re sending the right amount to your recipient and keeping your money safe.How to avoid currency exchange feesBelieve it or not, there are ways to avoid currency exchange fees altogether when sending money abroad. This is a clever trick that businesses use to save thousands in revenue each year.First, you need to set up a global business account. Global accounts (sometimes called multi-currency accounts) allow you to receive, hold and send multiple currencies across the world without charge. Here’s how it works: Say your business is based in the UK but a chunk of your customers are in the EU and pay in Euros. You also have EU suppliers that need to be paid in Euros. With a global account, you can collect Euros from your EU customers, hold them in your account, then use those Euros to pay your EU suppliers when the time comes. Because these transactions do not require you to exchange currencies, you will not be subject to any fees. This is by far the cheapest way to manage your money across borders.   How long will international money transfers take to clear?   This question is particularly pressing for businesses that employ staff around the world. Paying employee wages up to five days late is not a great look! Transfers sent via the SWIFT network will take between 1 - 5 working days, so are not the most efficient way to send money on a deadline. If you use a global business account that bypasses the SWIFT network, you will be able to make same-day transfers in most cases.   Transfer money abroad faster and cheaper with AirwallexAt Airwallex, we’ve built our own network of local payment systems that allow you to bypass the big banks and keep more of your money. With an Airwallex global business account, you can receive, hold and send multiple currencies across borders without excessive charges, putting thousands of pounds back into your bottom line.  If you need to make a currency exchange, you’ll benefit from competitive rates of 0.5 - 1% above the interbank rate—up to 90% cheaper than the high street banks. If you’re looking for an alternative to slow and expensive money transfers, apply for a free account today. Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

Connecting skills, creating opportunities•
ClassBento enjoyed its own journey of discovery•Airwallex empowered ClassBento to take control of their banking•Accessing a corporate market for even greater growthThe ClassBento platform was born to give users a taste of different creative outlets. It was designed as a way to encourage people to unplug, de-stress and help fight burnout in a hyperconnected world. But as the platform grew quickly, they realised their financial processes weren’t built to scale into international markets. ClassBento sought a next-generation solution that could help them move fast and cash in on the demand.
Connecting skills, creating opportunitiesClassBento was co-founded by friends John and Iain. Both working in high-pressure eCommerce roles, they found a creative and mindful outlet in taking craft lessons. But classes and teachers were difficult to find. Most teachers weren’t marketers, which meant they lacked the skills to promote their services and lessons. John and Iain saw the potential as the marketplace for these services was growing. They could help make these classes more marketable, more accessible (who’s free to take a woodworking class at 2pm on a Tuesday?), and as a way to create connections and opportunities for people looking to learn new skills.The name was inspired by the idea of a Japanese bento: a lunch box containing a taste of different things, many you may discover for the first time. ClassBento also honoured their very first service provider, a Japanese ikebana teacher who truly embodied the philosophy of the platform.
ClassBento enjoyed its own journey of discoveryThe platform resonated with a lot of people, and ClassBento grew steadily, delivering around 4,000 in-person experiences.And then COVID-19 hit.Snap lockdowns meant they had to pivot quickly and move their classes online. ClassBento created special kits for teachers with the necessary gear and teaching aids.But this hasn’t stopped the team. They quickly expanded from a small Aussie platform, to a global business launching into the UK in just a few months. Now they’ve got their sights set on the US.Airwallex empowered ClassBento to take control of their bankingIn the beginning, ClassBento was managing a lot of small payments, all across different platforms. But with so many users and teachers involved, they needed comprehensive automation, otherwise the system would fall apart. There had to be a better way.When they came across Airwallex, they discovered that our mass payouts infrastructure could enable streamlined payout methods for their online marketplace. By leveraging our unique API capabilities, ClassBento could take the shortcut to deliver large-scale, global payouts. They knew it would give their community of teachers greater flexibility and control—and their business a strategic advantage and market share in other countries.After a speedy implementation they had Airwallex up and running in less than a week.Automating their processes and payments meant they could scale internationally, pay their global teachers with a range of international currencies in an automated, cost-effective way. The ability to create virtual debit cards also simplified expense management for their growing global team, while empowering their employees to manage their own budgets.ClassBento was going from strength to strength.
“As we expanded to different countries, then Airwallex became even more useful. [Airwallex] helped us have financial presence across all these countries, very easily. The ability to create credit cards on the fly to manage employee spend is also super helpful.” — Iain Wang, Co-Founder at ClassBentoAccessing a corporate market for even greater growthOnce ClassBento made the switch to Airwallex, they started generating interest from corporate clients. These businesses now had a pathway to pay via bank transfer rather than credit card to match their internal accounts payable processes and eliminate the additional 2 - 3% international card payment fees.What’s ahead for ClassBentoCOVID-19 brought a once-in-a-lifetime shift to global ways of working. And through some quick thinking and careful pivoting, it actually helped ClassBento grow, allowing them to further their service offering. And they’re not slowing down any time soon. As restrictions ease all over the world, they’re going from strength to strength—continuing to expand into the US with both in-person and online classes.Their next steps are to look at ways to branch out from the marketplace side of things and build booking software that enables teachers to manage their workshops, classes and student bookings much more effectively.Airwallex will be right there with them when they do.
“[Airwallex] solves a lot of really important issues for ClassBento. You help us to improve efficiency… you enable things for us that we otherwise might not be able to do, to be honest,” says Ian.
“I can see that [Airwallex is] still kind of like a startup at heart... You’re still moving very quickly, adding lots of functionality over time—and that gives me confidence that [Airwallex] will be a partner that we can use in the long term, because you guys will be at the forefront of finance tech. To be a partner as we also grow globally.”

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/reduce-google-facebook-and-linkedin-ad-spend,"Reduce Google, Facebook and LinkedIn ad spend with this one hack","BlogReduce Google, Facebook and LinkedIn ad spend with this one hackTilly Michell9 November 2021•4 minsBusiness tipsIn this article•Why it pays to avoid Google and Facebook billing fees•Why UK businesses are charged additional fees when paying for Google and Facebook ads•How to get around Google and Facebook bank transfer fees•Paying for online adverts in different currencies•Keeping track of expenses in a borderless businessIf you advertise on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn, you probably spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve your conversion metrics and make your ad budget spread further. But did you know that you can spend less on online adverts just by changing the way you pay for them? Because Google, Facebook and LinkedIn adverts are billed internationally, companies can incur additional charges when paying their bills. Unless they examine their bank statements carefully, businesses might not know they’re being charged, or that there’s a way to avoid the fees.  Why it pays to avoid Google and Facebook billing feesWhen Google and Facebook adverts perform well, they can become the bedrock of your marketing strategy. But online adverts can also be a budget sink. Finding the right target audience and ad creative takes time, and businesses can easily spend thousands of pounds before seeing tangible results. For that reason, marketing teams feel the pressure to make every penny count, and will agonise over minute copy changes in order to move the dial. For businesses with tight marketing budgets, the pressure is even greater, and having a little extra to spend can make all the difference. Why UK businesses are charged additional fees when paying for Google and Facebook adsBecause Google, Facebook and LinkedIn adverts are billed in Ireland, UK advertisers are charged an international transaction fee when paying for online ads via bank transfer. These fees range from £15 — £17 per transaction, depending on who you bank with. If you have online ad accounts across several platforms and pay for each one with a monthly bank transfer, you could end up throwing away around £100 each month on unnecessary foreign transaction fees. How to get around Google and Facebook bank transfer feesThe best way to avoid bank transfer fees is to pay for your online ads via a card. Upload your card details directly into your Google or Facebook account and you will not be charged any transfer fees, whether you choose to ‘pay as you go’ or pay periodically.However, whilst this may seem like an obvious solution, it doesn’t suit all businesses. Putting ad spend directly on a company card can make it harder to keep track of expenditure and most companies prefer to manage outgoings via a centralised accounts system. Ultimately, many businesses decide to go with a monthly bank transfer despite the fees incurred. Airwallex provides a solution to this problem. When you sign up for a business account with us, you can issue virtual debit cards to your employees or projects, set limits for each card and track spend in real-time from a centralised account. Marketing teams can add their Airwallex card details to their online ad accounts and avoid transfer fees. Paying for online adverts in different currenciesIn some cases, businesses may wish to pay for online adverts in a foreign currency. For example, if your customers are based in the US and you mainly collect money in USD, you might also prefer to use USD as your billing currency.Here’s where things can get expensive. Banks charge up to 2.95% of the converted amount when you pay for Google, Facebook or LinkedIn adverts in alternative currencies. This charge is levied whether you pay by bank transfer or with a traditional payment card. So if you spend $20,000 a month on online advertising, you’ll pay $590 per month just in international payment service charges!To make things worse, once you’ve set your preferred billing currency in Google and Facebook, you can’t change it. So, if you chose USD when you set up your account, you will be stuck paying in USD whether you like it or not.  Fortunately, you can get around this problem by setting up a multi-currency business account. With a multi-currency account, you can pay for Google and Facebook adverts in the currency of your choice at no additional charge. Keeping track of expenses in a borderless businessAn upwards trend in online shopping has made it easier than ever before for eCommerce businesses to expand internationally. Being a borderless business comes with countless advantages, but it pays to be vigilant. Online advertising is just one of the ways you can be stung by currency exchange fees. There are many other areas—from purchasing stock to payment collection—where you can be charged for sending and collecting money. To avoid unnecessary fees, apply for an Airwallex multi-currency business account. You won’t be charged any set up or account fees, and can start saving money on international transactions immediately. You can make international money transfers in multiple currencies, in one business day or less.Related article: What's the Difference Between CHAPS and BACS Payments?Back to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

To support the growth of the business, Airwallex recently completed a Series E fundraising round, valuing the business at US$4 billion. In a forum to discuss the forces and ideas reshaping the future of money, or in fact, the future of how businesses operate, Airwallex played a key part of the conversation this year; exploring themes around embedded finance, globalization, and transformation, with a future focus perspective as businesses of all sizes are looking for more global, and more inclusive financial solutions.At Money 20/20 Amsterdam, Jed Rose, Airwallex’s General Manager, EMEA, took the stage as a panelist in a lively discussion about what cross-border trade with zero intermediation would look like, focusing on the increasing capability of existing rails to make faster, more secure payments globally. Jed commented how standardization is an important piece in driving efficiency, and fintechs’ critical role in demystifying the payment process for customers who are looking for a simple solution. Shifting to the U.S., Money 20/20 Las Vegas was an opportunity to celebrate and gather as a team following Airwallex’s launch in the U.S. in August. As some may already know, Airwallex was inspired by real-life experiences. Out of their love for good coffee, two of Airwallex’s co-founders, Jack Zhang and Max Li, started Tukk & Co, a coffee shop in Melbourne. As small business owners, they recognized first-hand the impact of high FX fees and banking costs on their profit margins, and sought out to build a better solution for businesses operating cross-border. Paying homage to Airwallex’s roots, Airwallex met with other Money 20/20 attendees, speaking with hundreds of individuals over a cup of coffee (what else?) at an Airwallex-branded coffee bike. People came for the coffee, but stayed for the company.Live events like Money 20/20 not only allow for teams to meet in-person after a long period of Zoom calls, but also for organic interactions to happen by bumping into an old colleague or friend, or spontaneous meetings to take place. Given how global and internationally-focused Airwallex is - not just the business, but the teams as well - it was important that employees from all over were able to get together. In fact, aside from talking about the latest financial technology trends and activities, the most popular topic among attendees was the excitement everyone had about meeting in person again, many for the first time, to be able to socialize, and to do something as simple as to grab a coffee with one another. Digital transformation has introduced tremendous opportunities in the financial industry. That way money is managed and transferred has, and will continue to change dramatically. The future of money, and the future technology will continue to merge, and Airwallex will continue to be a part of this ride! Vivien Cheung is part of Airwallex’s Strategic Partnerships team.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/iban-discrimination-what-is-it-and-what-are-my-options,IBAN discrimination: what is it and what are my options?,"BlogIBAN discrimination: what is it and what are my options?Jullian Duran4 November 2021•2 minutesFinanceBusiness tipsWhen the European Union was established, it opened up a world of opportunity for European businesses and consumers, giving people access to one of the largest markets that exists today.But with the rise of innovative global fintech, consumers and businesses who live and work across Europe are now fighting against what’s called ‘IBAN discrimination’. This phenomenon prevents people from paying and getting paid using their local International Bank Account Number (IBAN), only because of their country code.
What is IBAN discrimination?If a European business in one of these 36 SEPA countries asks you to provide a bank account based in that same country, that’s called IBAN discrimination. The good news is that IBAN discrimination is illegal, plain and simple. But if you do find yourself caught between a rock and a hard place, it’s helpful to know your options.Whether you’re doing business in Germany or France, an IBAN from Estonia or Belgium works just fine. In fact, this has been true for seven years now. Don’t believe it? Read the EU law for yourself. There’s also a list of competent authorities, which you can access if you’re curious which authority is responsible for policing this in your country. Admittedly, the real world can take some time to catch up to the law. We’ve heard customers complain about service providers, contractors, and even banks asking for IBANs from particular member states like Germany or France. The geographical discrimination got so bad in Italy that the country actually fined Vodafone over it. This practice can be counterintuitive, as many smaller EU countries often have much more advanced digital payment infrastructures. Take Estonia, for example. As one of the first EU countries to adhere to SEPA Instant Credit Transfer, Estonia’s online banking stands head and shoulders over other EU member states. What does that mean for customers? Faster, cheaper, and less restrictive banking.How do I report IBAN discrimination?If you are still hesitant about risking getting your IBAN rejected, there are ways to alert authorities about IBAN discrimination. Fintechs across the world have banded together to report IBAN discrimination—and you can too by citing offenders.Join us in the fight against IBAN discriminationAirwallex is ready to help. If a company or bank refuses to accept your IBAN only because of its country code, contact us immediately. As always, we’re committed to empowering businesses to operate anywhere, anytime. The first two letters of an IBAN shouldn’t change your ability to do cross-border business.

Infographic of key report findings•Businesses benefit from zero international transfer fees when they switch to Airwallex An Airwallex poll of UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has found that more than three quarters plan to expand their international presence in 2022. But international currency exchange fees threaten to hamper growth. Airwallex surveyed 500 business decision-makers and found that 63% plan to expand their footprint on the continent next year, whilst 38% have plans beyond Europe. More than half of those surveyed want to grow their customer base outside the UK, whilst over two-fifths are planning to source new suppliers abroad. To support their growth, 43% of businesses will begin overseas marketing activities and establish new global trading partnerships. International transfer fees are a pain point for businessesGlobal expansion can present challenges when it comes to cross border payments. Traditional banks charge up to 3.5% for currency exchange, that’s in addition to fees of up to 2.95% for non-GBP transactions.   Businesses who trade internationally risk falling foul of double currency conversions—being charged once when they pay foreign suppliers, then a second time in reverse when they sell their products overseas.       Whilst SMEs acknowledge that cross-border fees are a pain point, more than half of those surveyed believe it takes too much effort to get around them, and 26% believe they cannot be avoided. 77% were resigned to the additional charges, agreeing that hidden fees are a “necessary evil” that is part and parcel of doing business across borders. Despite this, over two-thirds agree that businesses that fail to take action to reduce the fees associated with global trade risk stunting their growth. 75% said that the money wasted on international transfer fees could be better invested in other areas such as marketing and headcount.  Digital adoption essential for accelerated international growthThe study drew attention to the role that technology will play in enabling UK organisations to expand overseas, particularly in regards to financial management. 66% of SMEs believe that companies that fail to adapt their banking strategy for the digital age will struggle to keep up with competitors. And the majority feel that organisations that don’t have a real-time overview of their expenses, transactions and transfers are not in control of their finances. To manage finances efficiently, many businesses are planning to move away from traditional banks towards a FinTech solution. 44% are planning to switch account providers within the next 12 months, 7% have already switched, and 68% would consider doing so in future. Jed Rose, GM, EMEA at Airwallex said, “As businesses throughout the world have been impacted by the pandemic, more innovative, tech-driven strategies are giving them the opportunity to enhance their globalisation efforts. “Whether it is the ability to open accounts in new markets within seconds, or combining all international payments into one platform for greater control and flexibility, identifying tech platforms that can enable end-to-end solutions which support business growth across borders can facilitate sustainable future growth for businesses of all sizes.”

Infographic of key report findingsBusinesses benefit from zero international transfer fees when they switch to Airwallex By opening a multi-currency business account with Airwallex, organisations can avoid international transfer fees altogether, no matter how much they send or how frequently. Thomas Adams is the CEO of Brandbassador and an Airwallex customer. “We used to pay Stripe between $5,000 and $10,000 a month in conversion fees because most of our customers pay in dollars,” says Thomas, “now we funnel that money into our Airwallex US dollar account, we don’t have to pay commission. We’ve saved more than $100,000 so far this year.”Airwallex supports SMEs as they grow, both domestically and internationally. As well as eliminating the cost of international money transfer fees, the platform allows businesses to track transactions easily, even when dealing in multiple currencies. Airwallex’s digital-first solutions range from online payment links to borderless virtual cards, allowing businesses to manage every step of their financial journey, from collecting money to paying expenses, from one account.  As UK businesses move towards a global future, Airwallex can help them manage their money more efficiently and cost-effectively.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/airwallex-enables-sona-to-scale-their-business-internationally,How Airwallex is enabling Sona to scale their business internationally,"BlogHow Airwallex is enabling Sona to scale their business internationallyTilly Michell2 November 2021•5 minutesCustomer storiesIn this article•A borderless business like Sona needs borderless tools•Leveraging the power of Virtual Cards•How Sona took control of their financesSona’s aim is to be the employee app for tomorrow's workforce, and empower frontline workers with tools that make their day-to-day lives easier.As a company with a big goal, and even bigger dreams, international expansion was always on the cards. The key challenge they faced was how to make this financially viable, and as streamlined as possible.A borderless business like Sona needs borderless toolsSona started their journey in the UK, and have since expanded to an international team with staff now based in Europe, Asia, and Brazil. And with eyes set firmly on the horizon, they’re looking to build an international customer base too.Oli Johnson, one of Sona’s three co-founders, tells us that while being big believers in the power of a distributed workforce, the Sona team realised early on that this doesn’t come without its challenges. When it came to paying distributed staff, they learned this the hard way. They began their journey with one bank account to receive all their funds, with a separate service to transfer money. And as bank fees started to mount, it quickly became apparent they needed a smarter way to do things. They needed a way to pay staff in different countries quickly, without being stung by exorbitant transfer and FX fees.Airwallex allowed them to consolidate their different bank accounts and payment platforms into one central account. They were able to gain transparency over their FX fees and transfer times—while seeing definite savings.“It’s nice to know that with Airwallex, you don’t have to plan and make this payment weeks in advance, you can just hit a button and know exactly when it will arrive.”
Oli Johnson, Founder at Sona
Leveraging the power of Virtual CardsAs the company continues to scale, Sona has begun looking for a way to quickly and easily send and receive funds.So, in the near future, they’ll be adding Airwallex Virtual Cards to their account. Oli says that the capability of Virtual Cards will be invaluable to his teams. They’ll be able to generate their own payment cards quickly, set clear payment limits, and delineate them by expense type. His staff will feel empowered to become more independent and gain the confidence to make important decisions for their vendors.How Sona took control of their financesSona’s vision is to be the tech enabler of tomorrow’s workforce and solve problems for workers all over the world. So they’ve got steady momentum to branch out into nearby countries, and have their sights set on planting a flag in the US market.They’ve got big ambitions—but they’re still a small team. So they recognise they need a strong support network to achieve this.Oli is effusive in Airwallex’s role in helping them expand. By partnering with us, they were able to take all the accumulating costs and increasing administrative burdens and completely remove them from the equation. By automating their day-to-day financial processes, they’re able to manage multiple payments and tasks at the click of a button.He says they feel supported, and backed by an engaged team that is available whenever they need it.Open an Airwallex business account for free and see the difference it makes to streamlining your growth.“Working with Airwallex has basically taken a bunch of processes and made them cheaper, and less in-your-face, on a day-to-day basis… It has certainly made our lives easier.”

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-switch-your-business-bank-account-in-the-uk,How to switch your business bank account in the UK,"BlogHow to switch your business bank account in the UKTilly Michell29 October 2021•5 minutesBusiness tipsFinanceTechnologyIn this article•Why switch your business bank account?•What’s the process for switching business bank accounts?Back in the day, companies had few options when it came to choosing a business bank account. High street banks ruled the roost and charged extortionate fees for account management, domestic transactions and international transfers. Today, the rise of challenger banks and FinTechs mean companies have more choice in how they manage their finances. Switching accounts has never been easier, and could save you a lot of money and stress. If you’re tired of clunky, outdated systems, poor customer service and unnecessary charges, it might be time to switch. Why switch your business bank account?Running a business comes with many challenges, but managing your business account shouldn’t be one of them. Here are some of the top gripes businesses have when it comes to their account provider. Poor customer serviceWhen you have a query about your business account, the last thing you want is to be placed in a call queue. In a recent Which? survey, 65% of banks scored just three out of five stars for communication, proving that most providers are failing when it comes to customer service.FinTechs and challenger banks know that customer service is a key way to undercut traditional banks, and have invested in ensuring their customers have the best experience.  So if you’re tired of listening to hold music, choose a business account that provides you with a dedicated account manager who will answer emails quickly and jump on a call when you need.  Hidden feesDo you scrutinise your bank statements? You should, because a lot of traditional business accounts have hidden fees. These include monthly account fees, transaction fees when you receive and deposit money, and additional charges for foreign currency transfers and CHAPs payments. It’s worth shopping around for a business account that doesn’t charge account or transaction fees. Not all providers are upfront about their fees, so make sure you read the small print. Limited card optionsCFOs are generally time-poor, and having just one company card can create bottlenecks that slow progress. By switching to a business account that offers multiple payment cards, you can empower your team to make independent purchasing decisions and free your CFO from constantly signing off expenses.  No multi-currency optionsA recent Airwallex survey showed that 77% of UK businesses plan to expand internationally in 2022, but two-thirds of decision-makers view international transaction fees as a “necessary evil”. In actual fact, businesses can avoid transfer fees quite easily by opening a multi-currency business account. As the name suggests, multi-currency accounts allow you to receive, hold and spend money in multiple currencies, so you can bypass currency conversion fees when paying international suppliers or collecting money from customers who live outside the UK.  What’s the process for switching business bank accounts?Switching business accounts has never been easier. Gone are the days when you had to book an in-branch meeting with your bank manager, you can now complete the process from the comfort of your home or office.1. Apply for a new business account Once you’ve chosen the account that’s right for you, you can apply online. Business account providers will run identity checks before you open an account. It should take 3-5 working days for your account to be up and running.  When you apply online, you will need to upload some documentation. This will include:Proof of identity, such as a picture of your passport or driving license. Proof of address, such as a bill or bank statement (if you’re a sole trader or freelancer).Certificate of incorporation, memorandum and articles of association (if you’re a limited company).You may also be asked a few questions about your company, such as the industry you are in and the countries where you operate. 2. Update your collections processMake sure that customers start paying into your new account. If you’re an eCommerce business, that means updating the details in your payment gateway (i.e Shopify or Stripe). If your customers pay by bank transfer, let them know that you’ve changed your account provider and update the payment details on your invoices. You should also update PayPal if you use it. 3. Update your subscriptions It’s worth doing a quick audit of your direct debits before you switch, to ensure all your subscriptions are updated. Monthly outgoings will include online ad payments, software services and employee benefits.4. Move funds across Moving funds from one business account to another is free for some providers, but others do charge a fee. Login to your old online banking service and select ‘external transfer’. You’ll need your new business account number and sort code, so keep this handy. Your previous provider may want to verify that you are the owner of the new account. You can do this by transferring a small amount (i.e. £0.01) from your new account to your old one. Once you’ve completed this verification, you can simply transfer your money across. 5. Close your old account There’s no pressure to close your old business account when you set up a new one, and many companies choose to keep more than one account running. But be careful, some providers will continue to charge account fees even if you don’t hold money in them. In order to close your old account, you will need to fill out an account closure form, which can be downloaded from your provider’s website. Once you’ve emailed or posted your account closure form, your account will be closed within 5-10 working days.After you’ve closed your account, your statements will no longer be available online. If they don’t do so automatically, ask your previous account provider to send you your transaction history covering the past five years. Switch to an Airwallex business account and pay zero account fees or transaction chargesAirwallex was designed to help businesses manage their money in the cheapest and most efficient way possible. We don’t charge any account or set up fees, and we won’t charge you any transaction fees when you send or receive money in the UK or internationally. No matter how much you’re sending or how many transactions you make. You’ll pay just 0.5 - 1% above the interbank rate for international currency exchange, considerably less than traditional banks. We also provide up to 200 virtual debit cards per business, so you can empower your teams to make independent purchasing decisions. You can set monthly spend limits for each card and track expenditure in real-time, so you’ll always know where your budget is going. When you sign up for an account with us, you’ll be assigned a dedicated account manager, who will help you get set up and always be on hand whenever you have a question. If you’re looking for an alternative to pricey, outdated business accounts, apply online today or get in touch with our team for a demo.Related article: How to Open a Business Bank Account in the UKBack to blogShareTilly MichellContent Marketing ManagerTilly manages the content strategy for Airwallex.

Avoiding expensive international transaction fees with Airwallex•Issuing Visa cards online for employees instantly•Giving back to  Hong Kong start-ups and SMEs•Get multi-currency company cards online for free In 2017, the Hong Kong Insurance Authority launched the virtual insurance license scheme, ushering the city into a new era of technology-enabled insurance. Amidst this sweeping industry-wide reform, Bowtie became licensed as Hong Kong's first virtual insurer in 2018. The pioneering Insurtech brand empowers consumers to take control of life protection decisions for themselves by eliminating paper, commissions and intermediaries.
Avoiding expensive international transaction fees with AirwallexAt the forefront of driving transformation across the industry, Bowtie seeks to integrate insurance into our daily life. To make insurance more accessible, the brand opened a healthcare clinic that offers medical consultations and a coffee shop where customers can discuss their policies with staff.With multiple businesses under its umbrella, Bowtie regularly sources its supplies and equipment from numerous vendors and service providers located all around the world. Like many start-ups, Bowtie also subscribes to a number of SaaS applications, like Zendesk and AWS, which are billed in USD. Previously, Bowtie used local cards to make overseas payments to its suppliers or service providers, bearing heavy foreign exchange and transaction fees imposed by banks. With the help of Airwallex, Bowtie is able to save on global payments by eliminating such tedious fees.Airwallex offers free multi-currency company cards that allow users to make online payments in multiple foreign currencies and can be used wherever Visa payments are accepted. Now when paying for SaaS subscriptions, Bowtie can directly settle its payments in USD with Airwallex Borderless Cards. Airwallex also offers market-beating foreign exchange rates and a convenient 24/7 web portal that allows users to carry out instant foreign exchange conversions – empowering Bowtie to make faster payments across the globe at lower rates.“After using Airwallex, we are able to use their Company Cards to directly settle our foreign currency transactions. Airwallex doesn’t charge us any international transaction fees or TT fees. Their FX rates are also relatively competitive. Through Airwallex, we can save around 3-5% for these foreign currency payments.""Bowtie’s Deputy Chief Finanical Officer, Edwin Wong.BOWTIE DEPUTY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER: EDWIN WONG This means for every HK$100,000 Bowtie spends on overseas business expenses, Airwallex helps Bowtie save around HK$3,000 to HK$5,000 in unnecessary fees.Issuing Visa cards online for employees instantlyAnother benefit that Bowtie has reported after using Airwallex is the increased control that it has over its team budgets. Prior to signing up for Airwallex’s service, like most businesses in Hong Kong, Bowtie relied on an inefficient employee expense reimbursement model to pay its staff back for business-related spending. When an employee placed an online ad or purchased a piece of equipment, they had to first make the purchase with their own money and create an expense report to get reimbursed after the fact. This created additional paperwork for both the company and staff. However, due to the lengthy application process with banks, Bowtie found it almost impossible to issue company cards for all its employees. BOWTIE TEAMThanks to Airwallex employee cards, Bowtie is able to issue free virtual Visa cards to its employees instantly online, enabling teams to make purchases easily to get the job done.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-open-a-business-bank-account-in-the-uk,How to open a business bank account in the UK,"BlogHow to open a business bank account in the UK18 October 2021•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•How to open a business bank account•I run a foreign business—can I open a business bank account?•It pays to be mindful when opening a business bank account•Skip the paperwork and wait times with an Airwallex Global AccountGrowing your business is an exciting time, as you’re seeing the tangible outcome of all your hard work. And as a thriving business, you need a bank account to match.Opening a business bank account marks a step-change in your business financials. It provides a central place for your finances, keeping them separate from your personal account. You’re able to streamline how you track and manage your expenses and cash flow, making it much easier to keep tabs on your tax liabilities.How to open a business bank accountWhen opening a business bank account in the UK, the process itself is reasonably straightforward, and there are a number of key documents and pieces of information you need to provide.These include:Proof of ID for all named company directors. This can be a passport, national ID card, or a driver’s licence (must have a photo)Proof of address. You can use a recent bank statement, utility bill, or a council tax statementFull business name and contact detailsYour Companies House registration numberEstimated annual turnoverIn some cases, your personal financial history, to confirm you have a clean credit and banking recordWhen opening a business bank account in the UK, in some cases major banks (HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, and the Royal Bank of Scotland among others) let you open an account online. But this is only to begin the process. Most banks require proof of residency upon application.Following online registration, in most cases, you’ll still need a face-to-face meeting with your bank to allow you to open an account with them. They’ll ask you to provide all the necessary business information listed above, and photo ID of all named directors of your business. 
The bank will also need to have a face-to-face meeting with your company’s UK representative in order to sign a bank mandate that enables your company to open an account.
Once you’ve had all the necessary meetings, filled out all the necessary paperwork, and provided all the relevant documentation, it’s time to play the waiting game. 
You should expect it to take anywhere from three weeks to twelve weeks for your account application to be approved. So make sure you build this time into your planning.I run a foreign business—can I open a business bank account?While there are no specific rules expressly forbidding international businesses from opening a business bank account in the UK, there is due diligence required that can make it difficult for some foreign businesses.The good news, however, is that opening a business bank account in the UK is as easy as it’s ever been, as recent years have seen banks afford greater flexibility to non-UK residents. But it isn’t as straightforward as opening a personal account—there are still hoops to jump through to know how to open a business bank account.Some banks, while in theory having the option for foreign businesses to open an account, in practice don’t offer any financial products for companies that aren’t registered in the UK. Many UK banks have the option to open an ‘international account’. These are specifically designed for non-UK residents and don’t require the same strict documentation requirements as a standard UK bank account.The key thing you need to open a bank account in the UK is proof of residency. So if you’re a UK resident for tax purposes, and have a residential address, then it’s smooth sailing. If you’re an overseas business, and you have an account with a global bank, you may be able to have your local bank branch liaise with your selected UK bank and open an account online for you. This typically only works if there’s an existing relationship between the two banks.It pays to be mindful when opening a business bank accountWhile opening a business bank account can seem like a step in the right direction, it’s important to know what you’re getting yourself in to. Be sure to read all the small print and product details before you sign off on your new bank account.With some UK banks, opening a business bank account comes with the requirement to make a substantial initial deposit. There may also be the requirement to deposit a minimum amount each month to keep your account active. This may not be feasible if your business is just starting out.On top of this, there may be expensive monthly fees attached to your account. This might take the form of fees just to hold the account or fees for opening an account in another currency. Be careful to check the fine print, too. In some circumstances, there may be lock-in periods in which you’re unable to close the account or switch to a better deal.From a purely practical point of view, opening a business bank account is becoming harder, as we’re seeing more and more bank branches close for good. In fact, the period from 2015 to 2019 saw more than a third of the UK’s bank branches shut down. This is making life particularly hard for rural business owners, who are now finding it more time-consuming to reach their nearest branch.Skip the paperwork and wait times with an Airwallex Global AccountSetting up an Airwallex Global Account is a smarter, quicker way to manage your business’ finances—and you don’t need to know how to open a business bank account at all.With easy sign-up, you open an account online and can get your account up and running within the day, without needing to leave your home or office.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/naomi-simson-grow-retain-talent,"Attract, Develop, Retain: Top Talent to Transform Your Business with Naomi Simson","BlogAttract, Develop, Retain: Top Talent to Transform Your Business with Naomi Simson15 October 2021•11 minsBusiness tipsStart-upsGuidesIn this guide•Attracting top talent: Unlocking potential•Developing top talent: Challenging people for greatness•Retaining top talent: The four Ps of leading high performing teams•Final thoughtsTop talent has the power to transform your business completely. Top talent also contributes diverse thinking and ways of working. However, in a globally competitive environment, it is not only enough to attract the top talent; you also need a culture that develops and retains high performers. Traditional models of recruitment, performance conversations and working styles are long gone, so how can we go about rethinking them?Attracting top talent: Unlocking potentialIt should be no surprise to hear that attracting top talent is critical for any business success. Whatever your business is, and whatever your strategy is, having good people is absolutely core to your productivity as a business and the strength of your culture. According to McKinsey (Attracting and retaining the right talent, 2017) top talent can be more than eight times more productive, particularly for high complexity roles.Productivity and efficiency are not the only benefits that can be realised from hiring top talent. Unlocking potential from a neurodiverse team will offer you different perspectives, ideas, and creative thinking. These uniquely human skillsets cannot be provided by streamlining processes or investing in new technology. Attracting neurodiverse talent gives you the best of the best, not just from top individual talent but also from a team working together to navigate and solve difficult and complex problems.Attracting and recruiting top talent is incredibly competitive. You need the right people at the right time for the right role. You also need to be thinking ahead, mapping your recruitment strategy to your overall business strategy. Recruitment serves a dual purpose, fulfilling your needs for the here and now and building a pipeline of incredibly talented and dedicated people who align with your vision and values.Attracting a neurodiverse team means that traditional processes of recruitment need to be re-evaluated. There are many ways to solve a problem and many ways of communicating an outcome. Asking great questions even from the start can give people the opportunity to showcase the best version of themselves.""Even right at the beginning of a recruitment cycle be able to say, 'Now, how would this process work best for you? How will you show us how you're going to fit into our organisation and do your best work?'"" – Naomi SimsonSome barriers to entry for some differently-abled or neurodiverse people have been reduced in the advent of remote and flexible working. By challenging our assumptions and biases right from the start, we avoid recruiting a team that looks and operates exactly like ourselves.Reflection: When was the last time you re-evaluated your recruitment processes?The past 18 months have catalysed global working trends. The gig economy, remote working, and flexible performance-managed roles are here to stay. The talent pool you can tap into (and your competition with it) is now truly global.Developing top talent: Challenging people for greatnessDeveloping trust is key to embracing the increased transience, flexibility and adaptability of how we work. The first step in developing (and retaining) top talent is to develop trust. The second step to develop top talent is to challenge people for greatness. We can do this by asking fantastic questions. After all, you hire amazing people to do what they can do, not be told exactly what to do and when.First: Developing trustLet's get right to the root of the issue of why we don't or believe we can't trust. One of the biggest enemies to trust is fear. If you are afraid that your employee/team member will (a) let you down, (b) betray you, (c) lie to you, then this is an excellent opportunity to do some soul searching and ask yourself, ""why do I feel this way?"" Perhaps you have been let down in the past or have been betrayed. Maybe you've tried this flexible working before, and it didn't work – or perhaps you have a set of high standards for yourself that include multiple unwritten rules that you, and others, need to abide by.""We have a framework by which we operate. We have a plan; we have a strategy, we have pillars; we have tactics. Ultimately, we have performance areas, but really telling somebody 'you take it this way and you do it that way,' is really uninspiring for anybody."" – Naomi SimsonThe core principles to developing trust mean being open, honest, consistent and accountable. It is a type of trust with boundaries and clear expectations. People are managed through relationships, not just through the process. Developing trust creates an environment of psychological safety that fosters different perspectives, ideas and creative thinking. Remember those? The uniquely human skills in which you hired the top talent in the first place.Second: Challenging for greatnessSetting the bar high can be easy as a leader. But keeping that bar high is another thing altogether! Asking great questions and listening deeply is a way to understand what is going on when a standard is not met. As a leader, you are the one responsible for coaching your team to greatness. While you cannot force your team to do anything, you can inspire them to be the best version of themselves.""Leaders should be listening far more than they're actually speaking. One way to do that is through asking amazing questions."" – Naomi SimsonExample questions:So, tell me _______. You've been working on this project. Is that your best work?Are you able to recount to me your understanding of the brief?What aspect of this work are you least proud of? Why? How would you do it differently in the future?What skills do you have that you believe we could have made better use of?Using these questions assists you in being able to diagnose (rather than assume) what the real issue is. After all, it could be you and your communication skills! Was it a misunderstanding of the work or timelines? Was it a resource or system constraint? Was it a skills gap?Ultimately you want to find out what that person needs to ensure they can do their best work and whether they are able to do what is being asked of them (in the time, with their skills, or the impact of other life events).If you ask great questions within the context of a trusting relationship, then that individual knows (a) you're for them; (b) they can be honest with you about what they can and cannot do and; (c) you won't accept anything less than their best.Action: At your next one-on-one meeting with a team member, try and run the entire meeting by listening deeply and only asking questions.However, there is one area in which all best coaching conversations may eventually fail. Nothing is more toxic than an individual who doesn't have the same fundamental values as the business. This is particularly noticeable if you are a micro-business. With only a few employees – they'd better be engaged and aligned!Investing time to cultivate the right values within the working culture happens from the beginning, and anything that is misaligned with the desired business culture needs to be addressed as soon as appropriate. It's never about the person or their personality; it's all about the quality or timeliness of the work, the outcome.""We don't like gossips and we don't like bullies... If you see those behaviours, you cannot walk past it. You got to say it in the moment."" – Naomi SimsonJust as culture is built over several small conversations and moments of feedback and questioning, nothing can replace an intentional 1:1 conversation about performance, progress and potential.This Conversations to Challenge for Greatness template will assist you in communicating the following with clarity:Performance: employee expectations as an individual and within the broader business strategyProgress: how their work meets these expectations and their potential. What are the blockers to progress? How can you (both) address these?Potential: what is the untapped potential in this employee? What will bring out their best?Retaining top talent: The four Ps of leading high performing teamsNaomi swears by the four Ps of leading high performing teams. Passion, Positivity, Persistence and Purpose. With leaders as the number one reason of setting culture and sustaining culture, they are also the number one influential factor in retaining top talent.1. PassionIt all starts with passion. To identify passion is to identify the moments in life when you're ""in the flow"" and time just goes by. That level of energy is impossible to fake, and it is also incredibly attractive. Identifying what your top talent is passionate about will mean that you can craft a work role and environment that not only is attractive, but also brings about the best from that person.2. PositivityYour words have the power to create. They can create positive environments; they can create possibilities. If you have trouble speaking positively, decide now that you are going to choose to respond rather than react. If that means that you need to take time out – then do that.3. PersistenceCommonly mistaken for being stubborn or ""pig-headed"", persistence is a different kind of beast. Unlike stubbornness, persistence may mean that you are constantly changing courses, listening and responding to others and the environment around you. However, like stubbornness – your vision remains constant as you continually pick yourself up and stay the course toward the vision.4. PurposePurpose is absolutely fundamental to why you show up every day. Your purpose defines the vision that you cast with your team. Purpose reveals how you are going to leave the world a better place.Final thoughtsUnlocking the potential of your top talent can start from day one. It’s a win-win situation when you are happy and your employees are happy doing meaningful work that taps into their unique skills and experience. The process starts with self-reflection and assessment. We are all individually responsible to make the changes we can in a positive direction. Whether that’s asking better questions, calling out behaviour that is misaligned to the values, or the power of positive speaking. Each of these small actions amounts to big changes in attracting, developing and retaining top talent.Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/multi-currency-payment-gateway,Multi-currency payment gateways: A better way to accept payments globally,"BlogMulti-currency payment gateways: A better way to accept payments globally7 October 2021•6 minutesTechnologyE-commerceIn this article•What is a payment gateway?•What is a multi-currency payment gateway?•How does a multi-currency payment gateway work?•The benefits•What to look for in a multi-currency payment gateway•Pricing & FeesPayment gateway technology has been instrumental in enabling eCommerce businesses to grow. They help businesses get up and running quickly and offer a seamless and secure checkout experience. But when it comes to expanding internationally, most payment gateways come with some costly fine print: foreign currency fees. For one-off payments, this might not be a huge issue. But over time, those fees add up, and they can cripple your business before it’s had a chance to lift off.But first, let’s define what a payment gateway is. Then, we’ll explore how an international payment solution can help your global eCommerce business expand with higher margins.What is a payment gateway?A payment gateway is the technology platform that enables you to accept online payments in your home currency. It’s a secure checkout portal that guides your customers through the steps that allow them to make a payment to your business’ bank account.Chances are, you’re already familiar with a payment gateway. The portal lets your customers add in their credit or debit card details, enabling a smoother, seamless payment experience, and greater efficiencies than a traditional bank transfer.
But here’s the problem: payment gateway providers typically charge an additional fee for merchants using their platform. What is a multi-currency payment gateway?Like most payment gateways, a multi-currency solution lets you accept and make payments through a secure online portal. The big, cost-saving difference is that it provides businesses and users with currency flexibility for global customers. They can choose to make payments in either their home currency or common global currencies, like USD, EUR and GBP.So for example, for an Australian eCommerce business, a multi-currency payment gateway would enable you to accept payments in USD, and withdraw USD, without being slugged with additional foreign currency transaction fees. 
Effectively, it’s an international payment gateway that makes it easier to accept payments from international customers, widen your reach, and grow your customer base. But be sure to read the fine print…Confusingly, many platforms that claim to be multi-currency payment gateways don’t actually offer your business this flexibility behind the scenes.Often, they’ll label themselves as such, purely because they accept lots of international currencies and payment methods. But in practice, they force-convert the currency back to your native currency and charge you a transaction fee on the side.A true multi-currency payment gateway enables you to settle in multiple currencies. So for example, if your customer pays in GBP, you can settle and withdraw in GBP without being forced to convert to AUD first.
So when looking into the best multi-currency payment gateway for your business, be sure to check that the platform is legit. You don’t want to get caught out.How does a multi-currency payment gateway work?Here’s how a multi-currency payment gateway works, in simplified terms.Your customer decides to make a payment. They head to the checkout on your eCommerce site and get taken to the payment gateway.They’re asked to enter their credit or debit card details. They enter their details, confirm the payment, and then everything’s completed on their end.The payment gateway then sends your customer’s card details to your nominated payment processor (typically, your bank) through a secure gateway.Your bank analyses this information and determines which payment network their card details belong to. This can be either a straightforward EFTPOS network or credit card provider.The payment then gets routed back to your customer’s bank or credit card provider. These details and payment amounts get authorised, with fraud detection procedures occurring to make sure the payment request is legitimate. Once the payment is authorised, both you and your customer should receive notification that the payment is completeThe payment is then settled—this is where the magic happens. When using a traditional payment gateway, the money will typically go through a forced conversion (usually at your expense) where the sum gets exchanged from its original currency into your receiving currency. With a multi-currency payment gateway, this doesn’t happen. The money goes straight through to your nominated bank account and is held in the received currency.The benefitsIt’s cheaperThis is a big plus for businesses dealing with large volumes of international customers. You pay less on conversion fees and get better margins on your income. As an eCommerce business, this can have a big impact on your profit and ability to price competitively.It’s easier—for everyoneYou can settle and hold funds in multiple currencies, without having to go through the currency exchange process. It’s easier to pay your suppliers or marketing costs in international regions. Your customers can pay directly in their home currency, making it a much easier process to purchase from you. And when it’s easier to purchase from you, there’s less friction in making that sale.It’s more secure for your moneyAs an international payment gateway, the technology behind it is already secure. But it’s also better for your exchange rate. Settled currencies can be used to hedge against currency fluctuations, meaning you can keep more of your money in your account, without worrying about losing it to the whims of the market.What to look for in a multi-currency payment gatewayWhen shopping around for the best multi-currency payment gateway for your business, there are a few key features that you need to look out for.Multiple currenciesIt should be a given, but a multi-currency gateway is no good if it doesn’t offer the currency options you need. Be sure to check the full list of currency options before signing up with any platform.Multi-currency settlementMake sure you’re not only able to accept foreign currencies, but settle and withdraw in those currencies too—without sneaky conversion fees.Multiple billing methodsGive your customers and suppliers more options to pay you. A good multi-currency payment gateway will be able to support multiple billing models, such as recurring payments, shopping platform integrations, and invoicing using payment links.Fraud protectionMake sure your gateway is secure with built-in fraud protection and authentication tools, such as the 3DS fraud engine. This helps to reduce chargebacks and increase the acceptance rate of payments.Flexible integrationYou want your payment gateway to reduce your workload and get you up and running faster. So make sure it offers flexible integration with your existing payment platforms. Things like low-code options to integrate into your website, or hosted payment pages at the click of a button. Pricing & FeesThere are typically two pricing models associated with multi-currency payment gateways: interchange++ and blended pricing.Interchange++Interchange++ is a type of pricing commonly used in North America and Europe. Under this model, the fees associated with processing the payment are separated into three parts: the interchange fee, the scheme fee, and the margin you make.The interchange fee goes directly to the bank that issues the payment card. According to the RBA, the current average interchange fee is around 0.5%, so expect to pay around that amount.The scheme fee goes to the card provider. Current Mastercard rates can be anywhere from 0.18% to 0.80%, plus GST.The margin goes to you. This is typically what you, as the merchant, add on to the payment in order to cover the other associated fees. 
The interchange and scheme fees will depend on the type of card used, the banks involved, and the country both parties are in.Blended pricingBlended pricing is a simplified version of interchange++ pricing, where all the associated fees and processing are merged into one simple fee. This usually takes the form of a percentage fee, plus a small set dollar fee per transaction. So for example, you may expect to pay 1.8% plus a $0.30 or 0.60 transaction fee.The blended pricing model means you get a better idea of what fees you’re likely to pay each transaction, as it’s not reliant on individual bank or card pricing modelsA note on forced currency conversionsWhen using a standard payment gateway, you may also be required to pay fees on forced currency conversions when settling funds in the available currency. They typically incur an additional percentage fee on top of your payment gateway provider’s fees. And that’s not all: you’re also being exposed to your bank’s poor FX rate. This is usually hidden, so you may not know what the real conversion rate is.These forced conversions may seem part and parcel of international transactions—but they don’t have to be.Airwallex provides a better multi-currency payment gateway solutionAirwallex is here to help you streamline your international payments via a feature-packed, multi-currency payment gateway and foreign currency account to match.When you open an Airwallex account, you’re furnished with an Airwallex Wallet which enables you to send and receive funds in international currencies.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/naomi-simson-cashflow-confidence,Follow the Money: How to Develop Cashflow Confidence with Naomi Simson,"BlogFollow the Money: How to Develop Cashflow Confidence with Naomi Simson6 October 2021•8 minsBusiness tipsStart-upsGuidesIn this guide•What is cash flow?•Counting every dollar•Making money work for you•Final thoughtsTime is money, right? Or is it money is time?If you think of a business as a living organism, cash is the lifeblood of the business. One of the main reasons businesses fail is not that they don't record a profit; they run out of cash. Running out of money is the quickest pathway to closing down a business. In the present circumstances, you may feel that your business is on life support. For others, it is the perfect environment for business to boom. Either way, it's essential to know where your cash is and monitor your business's health and wealth.What is cash flow?Skilling yourselves: Understanding cash flowCash flow is how money travels through a business. It's not just the destination; it's the journey. Often, we can think of cash flow as money in, money out. However, cash can have many destinations, pit stops, and detours. Knowing exactly where your money is and where it is not is important for any business owner or business leader. So important, it is one of Naomi's top priorities for business owners.""Don't be afraid to talk about money. Money's okay."" – Naomi Simson.Your big vision, your ability to change the world, to employ people, to contribute a sense of purpose in people's lives - all that requires money.  It is not enough to say, ""oh, my accountant does it."" Naomi encourages business leaders to take advantage of the myriad of courses available for individuals to skill themselves up and become cash flow confident.Where is the money?As you operate your business, cash flow is where the money goes to pay suppliers or pay for the value-added processes. In essence, it's the working capital required to make your business tick along. Particularly as global supply chains have, and are, being significantly disrupted, if you don't have a handle on where your cash is, then there's a genuine risk of running out of money to pay the bills. Not only have a baseline aim to be profitable but also to be cash flow positive.Terms of supplySome industries have more money detours or pit stops than others. Some industries are at greater risk of money detours or pit stops. For example, suppose you're a product or manufacturing-based business, and you need to buy components in advance. In that case, the terms of your supply are going to affect your cash flow significantly.The terms of supply are the terms and conditions of any supply agreement. For example, if you're buying components offshore, you could have terms of supply which mean you pay 50% at the placement of the order and then another 50% when those components exit the country. That means 100% of your cash is held up in stock or components – even before you get to see it! Counting every dollarConsidering alternative business modelsKnowing and negotiating your terms of supply is a critical aspect of becoming more cash flow confident and working out what works for your business. If you're a contract or micro-enterprise, could you request partial payment upfront? Or have payment in advance? Each business is going to have a different model that works for it. Seek expert advice. A key to becoming cash flow confident is to know the difference between what working capital you have and investment capital.Working capital vs. investing capitalWorking capital is the difference between your business's current assets and current liabilities. It's a ""spot-check"" at where your business is in terms of cash availability at any point in time. Investment, or investing capital, is the money the business can use to achieve its objectives. The investment can sometimes be in tangible elements, like specialised machinery, or it can be in intangible things, like an investment into a new automated process.The longer you can have that cash in your pocket (or bank), the longer you have an asset that you can use to invest in your growth. The key is to prioritise cash flow in your thinking. Until the money is physically in the bank, it's not a sale.Knowing your margins""Every dollar counts. Every single dollar. (When I started) I didn't realise the impact of just a few points of margin. Let's say you're turning over $10,000, and you're giving up 1 per cent. You think, 'Oh, okay, it's not so much.' But when you're turning over 100 million, 1 per cent is a lot of money."" – Naomi SimsonGetting the fundamentals right in your business (like negotiating terms of supply, mapping out your money journey) will reap enormous benefits for your business as you scale.There is also an extra layer of complexity when you're scaling globally. Aside from navigating the constantly changing landscape of global supply chains, there is a ""doubly whammy"" of navigating foreign exchange rates and operating in multiple currencies. With banks charging high fees, you can lose any margin you would have made in currency exchange fees.One option is to constantly monitor the foreign exchange and hope for the best. Another easier option is to hold your cash in the currencies you need to pay your suppliers. This is what you can do with Airwallex.Making money work for youBreathe. Finding your bandwidthSometimes our most precious resource, time, can operate like the difference between working capital vs. investment capital. In this case, every minute counts. You have probably heard of the adage, ""work on the business, not 'in' it."" But what should you do when you find yourself on the treadmill?""I often say, you know, who owns your business? Do you own the business or does it own you? And if it owns you, it's really time to have a talk to yourself."" – Naomi SimsonIn a previous article, leading leaders, we looked at what it takes to identify your unique leadership contribution. What can you contribute to your business that technology, other people, or further investment cannot match? Is it your creative thinking, your storytelling and vision casting? This is what you need to be focusing on. Regardless of the pace of change, navigating any kind of adjustment will come with a decision point. This is the moment where you need to start letting go of control and start delegating or outsourcing.Reflection: A great question to reflect on and ask yourself is, ""What do I love in my business? What do I loathe? Can this be outsourced?""Outsourcing 101Knowing what you love and what you loathe in your business is a great first step to prioritising where your cash goes. Directing your cash to be where it needs to be and protecting it from sitting in someone else's bank account (if it doesn't need to be there) can indirectly free up your time, energy and resources.Before investing in an asset (or person, or system), consider whether it will save you the time, energy or money so that you can be freed up a little more to focus on the best value that you can deliver to the business.

Describe yourself in one word? Personable. I enjoy meeting new people and I get along with most people. This is a trait that has helped me be effective and successful in sales.You’re originally from New Zealand. Why did you move to Australia and what were your early observations of Australia?I first moved to Australia in 2012. At that time, I had a career in fashion and was attracted to Australia’s burgeoning fashion industry. The first thing I noticed about Australians was that they pronounce certain words differently from us in New Zealand (such as neck-lace), but I quickly adjusted to it!While I miss my family in New Zealand, I’ve settled into Melbourne and am very happy to call it home.You’ve been at Airwallex for over 2 years. What’s the most rewarding thing about working at Airwallex?More than two years in, I am amazed at how I get to learn something new every single day. My prior experience was in fashion and knew nothing about the financial world when I first started at Airwallex over two years ago. I wasn’t sure if I would succeed here.I was fortunate to have bosses who took a chance on me and carved out time in their busy schedules to show the ropes. Colleagues from China even flew down to Australia to conduct specialised training. They taught me how to sell our platform, pushed me to practice my demo skills and even create my own demo flow, which is still the basis of our demo training today. It’s very rewarding to look back at that and see how much I have picked up in such a short span of time. As the second hire in the Australia sales team, it’s incredible to see the team expand to over 30 people today. I love that we get to work closely with product teams around the world, including the UK, Singapore, San Francisco and Hong Kong. Working with an amazing group of talented and clever people from different backgrounds pushes me to be my best self at work. We challenge each other by sharing ideas on how to get cut through with potential clients and how to engage in genuine conversations to help them in the best way we can. What’s the biggest misconception about your job? Most people think that account management is only about providing customer support. I see it as so much more than that, as it also requires ongoing relationship building to foster trust and rapport with customers. I build trust by doing what I say I am going to do. While it sounds simple, it works. By proving that I am reliable, for example, getting customers on alpha programs for new products or going back to them with an answer to a specific question, they know that I genuinely want to help. This means when they want to do something new or need support, Airwallex is already top of mind. 
What’s the most interesting conversation or memorable moment you’ve ever had with a customer? A new client called me one day to ask how he could use his Airwallex account to buy helicopters for a new tour business. I work with a wide range of customers from all walks of life and in different industries, but having someone call me about helicopters was definitely a first for me! I helped him set up his Airwallex account, and easily send large payments to his suppliers. The rest is history. (see customer story here).A memorable moment was getting to meet with the designer of a brand that I have long admired, as the brand became an Airwallex customer. I was fan-girling throughout the conversation! It was a lovely way to connect my history in the fashion industry with my new fintech life. What is your favourite way of connecting with your colleagues remotely?Something I started doing in 2020 when Melbourne first went into lockdown: I hold a 3pm ‘stretchy time’ every day, which is a 15-min Zoom session with whoever wants to get out of their seat for a quick stretch or some star jumps! What are customers most surprised about when you show them the Airwallex platform?The one thing that my customers marvel over the most about Airwallex is the ability to open international bank accounts and in their own business names – all in seconds. While this sounds simple, the traditional process can involve months of paperwork and being there in person. One client almost cried - of happiness! - because of how quick and easy it was. They also love how they can save huge amounts of money when paying suppliers and international contractors in their home currencies.For people considering a job with Airwallex, what are 3 things they can expect? Personal and professional growth. In just 6 months, you will have learnt so much about so many things - the product, the business and yourself. You will honestly surprise yourself with what you can do. Empowerment. You are encouraged to be a self-starter and problem solve autonomously, and then share learnings with your team. Everyone who works here has come from such diverse backgrounds which means we contribute in different ways; there is no one best way! Support from your team. My teammates at Airwallex are some of the best people I have ever worked with. Help is always offered when it is needed. No question asked is ever a stupid question, everyone here is learning and growing together! Looking to take the next step in your career? Check out our careers page for open roles.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/chaps-vs-bacs-payments-whats-the-difference,CHAPS vs. BACS payments: What’s the difference?,"BlogCHAPS vs. BACS payments: What’s the difference?Joe Romeo29 September 2021•5 minutesFinanceIn this article•What is a CHAPS payment?•What is a BACS payment?•So, what’s the difference between BACS and CHAPS?•Which transfer method is faster?•Which payment method is more expensive?•Airwallex international payments is a faster, cheaper alternative to both of theseWe’re in a pretty amazing time right now where we can open up a browser on our computer, head to our banking website, and send money to anyone, anywhere in the UK.This is great for businesses, as it simplifies how you send and receive payments. For the most part, you don’t even have to leave your office.But as a business, you’re typically transferring large sums of money on specified deadlines. You’re doing more than simply, say, paying back your mate for what you owe from the pub the other week.When making these types of high-volume or high-value transfers through your bank, there are two main payment networks you’ll be using: CHAPS vs BACS.So let’s look at the difference between BACS and CHAPS, and what this means for your business.What is a CHAPS payment?Despite its jaunty acronym, the full name is quite dry. CHAPS stands for Clearing House Automated Payment System.CHAPS is the bank-to-bank transfer system that runs through the SWIFT network. It’s typically reserved for once-off, high-value payments that need to be sent and received on the same day. So things like purchasing property, paying tax, or purchasing vehicles for your business. CHAPS payments start from £10,000 and upwards, with no transfer caps, and no upper transfer limit.These types of payments tap into a wide network, with over 30 direct banking participants and more than 5,000 financial institutions across the country able to make and accept CHAPS payments.What is a BACS payment?BACS stands for Bankers Automated Clearing Services.This is the bank transfer method that handles all direct debit and credit transactions. Because of this, it’s the most common bank transfer method used by UK businesses. BACS payments take longer than CHAPS payments, and are normally used for high-volume, low-value transactions (by banking standards, at least). BACS payments cap out at £250,000 per transfer.You use the BACS payment network for those routine payments you make on a daily basis. Think regular bank transfers, payments to suppliers, employee wages, and pension payments.The BACS system has been in operation for over 50 years, established in 1968, making it the system that everyone has grown up with and understands.So, what’s the difference between BACS and CHAPS?Basically, it all comes down to the service you’re after.CHAPS payments are for high-value, time-sensitive payments, such as a payment on a property or a large, expensive business asset. It’s for making payments you need immediately, that day.BACS payments are for routine, everyday payments that aren’t bound by time, such as paying your suppliers or sending your staff their weekly wages.Which transfer method is faster?BACS payments take anywhere from two to three days to complete, so you wouldn’t choose this method if you were in a hurry.CHAPS payments are faster by miles, offering bank-to-bank transfers within hours. You’re usually able to get same-day payment if your transfer is made prior to 3:00-5:00pm that day (depending on whether you choose in-person or online). Otherwise, next-day payment is available.Which payment method is more expensive?BACS payments are one of the cheapest ways to transfer money between banks. You can expect to pay anywhere from 5-50p (plus any additional fees charged by the banks) per transaction.CHAPS payments, on the other hand, are much higher. This is because your bank or payment partner is required to pay for access to and maintenance costs for the software and hardware needed to complete your transfer. For CHAPS payments you can expect to pay anywhere from £25-£35 per transfer. As such, you probably wouldn’t be making a high volume of these types of payments.Airwallex international payments is a faster, cheaper alternative to both of theseAirwallex exists as an alternative to both of these methods. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to make your payments. And we don’t think it’s right that you’re penalised simply for paying your bills, or your suppliers.So, with this in mind, Airwallex doesn’t charge you any fees for local or international money transfers. No matter the value you’re sending, regardless of the number of payments you’re making, you’re able to transfer money completely free of any fees.You get practically instantaneous, same-day transfers on all your transactions, too. This is because we use your local payment networks, not the SWIFT network, so your money is received in one business day or less—without the hefty fees.So if you’re looking to find a difference between BACS and CHAPS, try Airwallex foreign currency accounts instead for a cheaper, faster alternative.Get in touch with us today for a demo, and see how we can help you take the hassle out of making your business payments.Related article: How to Switch Your Business Bank Account In The UKBack to blogShareJoe RomeoSenior Growth Marketing Manager Joe Romeo is responsible for scaling our Airwallex's product adoption in the UK and the world.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/rotor-one-is-flying-high-over-melbourne,Customer Story: Rotor One is flying high over Melbourne,"BlogCustomer Story: Rotor One is flying high over Melbourne10 September 2021•4 minutesCustomer storiesIn this article•Helicopter experiences for everyone
•Customer cues – finding your fit•Streamlining systems – Airwallex in actionWith its eyes fixed above, Rotor One is preparing itself for the future of aviation – and only the sky's the limit.Some people have used lockdowns to learn how to bake sourdough, propagate plants or dance on TikTok. But for Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot at Rotor One, he fulfilled his life-long dream of becoming a helicopter pilot.
Edward is a serial entrepreneur, having started his first software venture 15 years ago and continues to maintain links to the software industry through his international consulting business. However, the coronavirus pandemic was an opportunity for Edward to take stock and re-evaluate his priorities.
""If I could choose anything to dedicate my life to, it used to be starting software companies, and that's all well and great. But if I wanted to be a little bit more adventurous, what would I really LOVE to be doing?"" – Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot, Rotor One
Helicopter experiences for everyone
Naturally, Edward took a leap of faith to establish Melbourne's newest aviation business, Rotor One - Melbourne Helicopter Rides. Rotor One provides tailored helicopter charter experiences, including scenic flights, brewery and winery tours to the Yarra Valley, and adventure-based heli-activities like heli-biking and heli-surfing.Spotting a gap in the market, Edward is on a mission to bring the exhilaration of helicopter travel to the people of Melbourne. He firmly believes that travel is so much more than getting from A to B. From day one, Rotor One has been customer obsessed and tech-enabled. Passionate about crafting unforgettable experiences for each and every customer, Edward readily uses technology to create compelling experiences that are perfect for social media, such as an option to live-stream your helicopter ride around Melbourne CBD.""I think everyone perceives helicopter and private aircraft charter to be for the elite. It should be accessible to everyone."" – Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot, Rotor One
Customer cues – finding your fitIt seems surprising that anyone would want to establish a heli-experience business in the middle of a pandemic. Yet this is the kind of challenge that Rotor One enjoys taking head-on.For guests looking to explore Melbourne by helicopter or go on a new and exciting adventure in Victoria, one of the major challenges for Rotor One has been finding the balance between new and exciting experiences for its customers and navigating a heavily regulated industry.
""It's like people would think and assume they can just land a helicopter in their backyard. Unfortunately it isn’t that easy; it is very highly regulated. So there's a fine line between being able to offer a really cool experience, but also maintain safety and comply with aviation law."" – Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot, Rotor One
Another major challenge is that helicopters are not cheap. Financing large assets as a young start-up is a big gamble that not many institutions are not willing to support. Rotor One has had to work hard to collect capital and source the right finance.For businesses looking to grow, Edward has two pieces of advice. First, you need to be unique. Really unique.""You have to stand out and have a product that's highly differentiated and ideally significantly better than the others. Understand your niche and understand what your customers really want."" – Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot, Rotor One
The second piece of advice is to be humble enough to ""test your thesis"". Edward encourages founders to be ready to amend, test and iterate that initial thesis before they expect to find their product-market fit.""I made this mistake early on… We were very focused on the idea that our product or service is going to be the thing that changes the behaviour of the market and allows them to operate in the more efficient way that we believe they should be working. That proved to be wildly unrealistic. It took us almost three years to really be honest enough with ourselves to be like, actually, people aren’t that readily open to change and we may be building for a romanticized view of the world that doesn’t exist."" – Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot, Rotor OneStreamlining systems – Airwallex in actionAirwallex has enabled Edward to operate multiple businesses in multiple currencies. The headache of receiving payments from international clients, making purchases in different currencies and then attempting to balance everything back in Australian dollars was solved by using Airwallex. Dedicated Global Accounts for each currency have also had their benefits for Edward who regularly has to handle large transactions with international vendors and suppliers in the aviation industry.Edward also uses dedicated Airwallex corporate cards to track different business expenses from helicopter maintenance to Facebook advertising and everything in between.Prior to using Airwallex, Edward used currency exchange platforms and had several accounts with some of the big banks, with one technical error rendering his account inactive for six weeks. It is the ease and simplicity of Airwallex that helped Edward manage every aspect of his accounts online was extremely important to him.Edward recalls the moment when he was making a large transfer to purchase the first helicopter in the Rotor One fleet.""It is two o'clock in the morning and I have 3 web browsers open and I'm quadruple checking all the amounts, account names, bank addresses, bank zip codes, sorting codes, account numbers etc. I’m having to initiate multiple, significant foreign exchange transactions across 4 different entities one after the other. Thankfully it all worked, but one wrong digit or character and the funds would’ve been sent to the wrong account and the transaction would’ve fallen through. I think the biggest benefit of Airwallex is that we can now consolidate all the transactions into a single process…It makes it so much simpler and safer."" – Edward Taylor, founder and Commercial Pilot, Rotor OneBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/leading-leaders-naomi-simson,Gathering and Guiding: Four Steps to Leading Leaders with Naomi Simson,"BlogGathering and Guiding: Four Steps to Leading Leaders with Naomi Simson8 September 2021•11 minsBusiness tipsStart-upsGuidesIn this guide•Step 1: Identifying as a Leader•Step 2: Knowing your strengths and weaknesses•Step 3: Gathering: The Why•Step 4: Guiding: The What and The How•ConclusionLeadership is a curious thing. It's an intangible quality and notoriously hard to define. What makes someone a leader? And how do you go about gathering and guiding leaders so that together you can navigate and grow in uncertain times?Suppose you are a company founder or a business owner; you know the importance of a unified leadership team. One of the most important aspects of being a leader is setting the vision and guiding your team in alignment with your values. When the path forward is no longer clear or straight, developing leaders who can lead is essential.We discussed with Naomi Simson what it means to grow as a leader and will further explore four steps to building effective leadership teams.Want more? Join Naomi's panel discussion the 29th of September for a deep dive into winning and retaining customers for your biggest Q4 ever! Register to attend here. Step 1: Identifying as a LeaderFounder as Leader""Often, the founder doesn't think of themselves as a leader. But that's their number one job. For them, and the people around them."" - Naomi SimsonBefore you can begin developing your leadership team, you need to start with yourself. Humans will often identify with multiple roles. We have different responsibilities as we interact with our families, friends, and colleagues. In some contexts, we follow or support, becoming cheerleaders, helpers or rescuers. In other contexts, we lead.If you are a company founder, it is essential that you first and foremost identify and own your role as a leader. You are not just a business owner, a creative, or an entrepreneur. You lead leaders. Identifying as a leader means becoming great at leading yourself. It requires self-awareness and a strong vision. It means taking a step back from the everyday tasks, thinking about where you want your business to be and why, and finally, inspiring everybody to unite toward that singular cause.The Difference between Leadership and Management""But I am a leader!"" – you say. That's excellent! Many business owners and managers have spent years leading a single project, leading a team of ten, or even leading 100 people. Still, they have not yet discovered how to inspire people outside their direct realm of influence. The terms ""leader"" and ""manager"" are often used interchangeably. Being a leader versus a manager is not a title change; it is a mindset. There are significant distinctions that set the two apart.""Management is about nurturing the uniqueness of the individual for the good of the cause. Leadership is about uniting everybody with their unique skills. For the good of the cause."" - Naomi SimsonOne of the most significant factors in having a manager or leadership mindset is your ability to let go of control. You have two choices; growth or control, but you can't have both. The seminal Harvard Business Review article ""Managers and Leaders: Are They Different?"" (originally published in May 1977 by Abraham Zaleznik) addresses some of the challenges in creating an environment where emerging leaders can flourish.Below is an adapted version of the original ""Idea in Practice"", which summarises some major differences between managers and leaders.Reflection: Glancing at the table, what resonates with you? Are you more of a manager or a leader? In what situations do you default to a manager or rise to be a leader? Why?Step 2: Knowing your strengths and weaknessesIn step one, you began developing your self-awareness around your manager versus leadership defaults. A critical part of identifying as a leader is the ability to lead yourself. But how does one exactly do it? Ironically, the underlying principle here is that it is not about you.With that in mind, here are a few pointers to get you started:Develop self-awarenessDeveloping self-awareness comes from listening to; those leading under you, your team members, mentors, whoever can offer valuable insight into your strengths and weaknesses.Know you and your team's unique contributionKnowing your strengths and your team's strengths helps you define your leadership contribution and the contribution of individuals in your team. This unique mix of personality, talent, skills, experience and networks makes each persons' leadership contribution invaluable. As they say, ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""Recognise you can't do everythingYou are not expected to do it all and be all things to all people. Recognising your weaknesses enables you to gather a leadership team with complementary skills. It also alerts you to the potential impact you could have on your team through your blind spots.Develop accountability structures around youDeveloping accountability structures around you will assist you to have a permanent posture of listening and learning. There are many benefits to surrounding yourself with people you can trust who will call you out on bad or blind behaviour and challenge you to be a better leader.Activity: Consider undertaking some form of strengths assessment. There are several available, such as CliftonStrengths by Gallup or the VIA Strengths Finder.However, these assessments are just tools. Nothing beats having real people around you who can call you to account! Who are the people around you who will keep you accountable? If you don't have anyone, who could you ask right now?Adopt a posture of learningLeaders who stop learning, stop growing. Maintain a curious spirit, enquire, investigate, learn, grow. Whether that's about your strengths and weaknesses, your team, or the environment in which you're operating. Curiosity develops your ability to see opportunities, assess risks and perceive what emotionally connects with your customers, clients and employees.Find your ""why""One of the critical differences between a manager and a leader, according to Zaleznik, is that a leader has a personal and active outlook. Innately we know that we are all made for a purpose. Find your reason to do what you're doing. Life is short, and having that laser-like focus on your ""why"" not only gives you the motivation to keep going when life gets tough but becomes the rallying vision for your team to get behind.In this next section, we'll look at some prompters to help you find your ""why"".Step 3: Gathering: The WhyPermission to DreamThe environment we're operating in is complex. It is increasingly challenging to hold onto set strategies, plans, and processes in a complex, uncertain world. With a manager mindset, this level of uncertainty can invoke minor panic or a feeling of being overwhelmed as we skip straight into the comfort of controlling through tactics and execution plans.There are a rare few that rally behind the promise of a new process. As a leader, dreaming big casts vision, ignites the imagination, and gives space for creativity. It positions the business to identify and execute on opportunities and develops agility to bounce back from mistakes or navigate unforeseen external factors. Leaders make ""safe fails"" rather than ""fail-safes"".Find your ""why"" requires you to start asking the big questions of life. However, no one said that dreaming about the future can't be fun! Give yourself and your team permission to dream. Invite everyone to contribute to the process. It's amazing what people think of when they are invited to dream about the business' ideal future – you may discover some great ideas.Permission to dream big also gives your business that invaluable competitive advantage. Perspective.This Dreaming Document provides some writing prompts for you to dream big. If you have either (a) rarely permitted yourself to dream and didn't know where to start or (b) want to involve your leadership team in dreaming, then this document may be a useful tool for you.Communicating the VisionNow that you have identified ""why"" you do what you do, the next step is to inspire your leadership team to gather behind this vision. You can do this by telling stories that shape the culture and spark the imagination of what is possible. Clearly articulating the vision is vital in unifying your team and giving your leaders the key messages and stories they need to inspire their teams.When leading leaders with diverse personalities and motivators, you need to tap into their ""why"". Storytelling that establishes an emotional connection is a powerful tool to inspire action.""The role of the leader is often about storytelling. It's about painting the picture. It's about showing people a better future. Remembering why you're there and your purpose."" - Naomi SimsonThe ""why"" behind your business should be the first story you communicate to your team and your customers. Naomi Simson talks about ""defining your company's job"". That is, tapping into the purpose that your product or service offers to your customers. Is your business providing comfort? A sense of connection? Feeling loved? Security?Reflection exercise: Now, it is your turn to get specific. What is the story behind your ""why""? What is the deeper need that your product or service can offer for them? Why should your customers, your stakeholders or your team care?Step 4: Guiding: The What and The HowSetting the StrategyIf the vision is the why, then the strategy is the what.Suppose you are a natural leader and your strengths are already in developing the long term vision and leading with purpose. In that case, it is even more critical for you to (1) define a strategy and (2) stay with it.As the leader, you unite and gather your leadership team under a common vision. A strategy helps you guide your leadership team to lead others. A strategy allows people to do whole and complete work that contributes toward the vision, giving them a sense of accomplishment based on their strengths. Most importantly, as a leader, it allows you to communicate how their work directly contributes to the ultimate vision of the business, which is key to uniting people toward achieving a common goal.There are hundreds of ways to develop a strategy and it will be a living document. The type and depth of strategy will depend on your industry cycles, business phase, and company culture. However, some of the common themes in setting a strategy include:Define a vision and your values (start with the dreaming exercise)Analyse your environment (exercises such as P.E.S.T.L.E or S.W.O.T can be helpful)Identify where the opportunities are and associated risksIdentify which ones you want to go for and which ones you won't (test these against your vision and values)Figure out when, where, how to go for those opportunities (and who will do it) and what the trade-offs areSet goals, measure, communicateReflection: Consider what your business is doing now. What trajectory is it on, and where will it be in two years or even ten years?Which activities, projects or products are most strongly aligned to your vision? Which ones are not (or no longer) contributing to your vision?Establishing your ValuesValues are all about what is most important to you and the business. They are the real mountain on which your business will either thrive or die. The values are CORE to what makes your business unique because they determine the how.Enacted values are categorically different from espoused values. It is essential to uncover the basic assumptions behind your business' enacted values before implementing any change.Develop observation skills within your leadership team by asking them to be your observers and listening posts. It would be helpful to observe your business in various circumstances.Action: What stories are being told about the organisation? What values are being expressed in customer interactions, employee onboarding or marketing activities? What is not being done?There is no shortcut. To close the gap between enacted values and espoused values, you need to go right to the roots and challenge the basic assumptions. Remember the accountability structure that you put in place earlier on? This is where their wisdom can really shine.ConclusionWhen developing your leadership team, people will gather under the vision, the strategy will guide them, but ultimately, they will go based on their values.First, identify as a leader. If you want to lead leaders, it starts with leading yourself. Define your why, know your what and, above all, interrogate your how. Second, know your strengths and weaknesses. This self-awareness allows you to articulate your unique leadership contribution and understand where you need to build a fantastic team around you.From this point, you can develop a solid leadership team from this place of clarity who can lead and inspire others to gather under a shared vision. As you navigate uncertain times, dream together, communicate together, and reshape the future together.Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-open-a-business-bank-account-in-the-united-states,How to open a business bank account in the US,"BlogHow to open a business bank account in the USJoe Romeo2 September 2021•6 minutesFinanceBusiness tipsIn this article•Do I really need a business bank account?•How long does it usually take to open?•Can I open an account as a foreign resident?•Can I open a business bank account in the USA online?•What do I need to open a business bank account in the US?•
An easy business banking alternative•What fees should I expect?•Which bank do I choose?As a growing online business, expanding your business to new customers, new states—even new countries—may sound like the dream.But as a growing business, what do you do about your finances?In this article, we’ll look at how to open a business bank account in the US, the benefits, and the US bank account requirements you need to be aware of.Do I really need a business bank account?As a smaller business or solo entrepreneur, you may not necessarily need a business bank account. But if you’ve got plans to grow your business—particularly if you’re looking to take on employees, or scale across the country—then it’s a critical step to look into setting up a US business bank account. 
There are clear benefits to opening a business bank account:It makes it easier to manage your business’ financials, separating them from your personal account.It makes tax time easier, as you can confirm that all the incomings and outgoings from your business bank account are purely professional.If you set up your business as an incorporated entity (which we’ll touch on later), this also works to separate your personal assets from the business, adding a level of protection should something go wrong in your business.It sets your business up for future growth and makes it easier to apply for business loans, add on extras such as corporate cards, and even makes it easier to take on employees.How long does it usually take to open?In theory, it shouldn’t take long to open the actual business bank account—usually no more than 15-30 minutes.
But that’s in theory. In reality, the processing of your new account details can take time, so expect to wait anywhere from five days to four weeks until your new business bank account is fully operational.Can I open an account as a foreign resident?Whether you can open an account as a foreign resident or not depends on the entity opening an account. To open a US business bank account as a business entity, then you’re required to be registered in the US, and you need to supply an EIN (Employee Identification Number). So if you’re a foreign-owned business entity, then unfortunately no: US bank business account requirements preclude you from opening a US bank account.
However, you can open a US bank account individually as a foreign resident. On the whole, there aren’t specific residency requirements stopping you from opening one.But there’s hope in sight for foreign businesses looking to open a bank account in the US; read on.Can I open a business bank account in the USA online?For US-based businesses and residents, it’s a fairly simple process. Most of the big banks allow you to open a business bank account online. Simply head to their website, choose the account you want, and you’re ready to go.Foreign residents may run into a hurdle, as most US banks require you to visit in person and physically hand over your necessary documents. You’ll also need to have proof of a physical US address in order to open an account.What about foreign businesses?For businesses looking at how to open a bank account in the USA from overseas, there’s a way to overcome this.
There are some specialist services set up to enable foreign businesses and entrepreneurs to open US bank accounts online. However these will differ depending on the state you’re looking at opening your business in, so it’s best to do your research to find a reputable agency in that specific state first.What do I need to open a business bank account in the US?If you’re asking ‘what do I need to open a business bank account in the USA?’ then honestly, the process isn’t as onerous as you may think. To make this as simple as possible, here’s a step-by-step guide outlining how to open a bank account in the USA.
Step 1. Do your research, and choose the bank that’s right for your business needs. Be sure to check their fees, services, and fine print.Step 2. Head online, or head into your chosen bank branch, and begin the process to open an account.Step 3. Be sure to bring all the necessary US bank business account requirements. These include:Photo ID of the business' director that's opening the account—in this case, you.Documents to prove your business' incorporation.Your business licence.Confirmation of your EIN. you can read how to get one here.Proof of your business' US address.And that’s it. If you’ve got all this information ready to go, it should be a relatively painless process opening a corporate bank account anywhere in the USA.
Be aware though, that some banks may require a minimum deposit in order to open an account with them, so be sure to check what this is prior to opening your account. 


An easy business banking alternativeAn Airwallex Business Account grants you access to a business account that’s just like a regular business bank account—but better. It’s quick to set up: just head online, create your account, and you can start using it immediately. You don’t even have to leave your house to do it. There’s no onerous paperwork, no holding periods, no 5-10 day turnaround, and you can start using it with a $0 minimum account balance.What fees should I expect?There are a number of different fees you can expect to pay once you’ve opened your business or corporate bank account.
Monthly account handling fees. It’s not uncommon for US banks to charge a monthly fee just for having an account with them. Some may charge $0 for a certain time period, while some may charge $12 or more per month. Some banks still may even waive these fees—as long as you hold a minimum threshold amount in your account.ATM fees. Much like a personal bank account, if you’re looking to take out cash you can expect to pay ATM fees if using the ATM of a different provider. These can vary, ranging from low, to $2.50, to $5 or more per transactionTeller fees. Banks are encouraging users to perform as much of their banking online as possible, and many have started charging fees for banking with a teller. So be aware of this. This is usually around $3 - $5 for daily transactions, with international transactions incurring their own set of fees.International transfer fees. International transfer fees in America can vary wildly, starting at approximately $15 and going up to as high as $45 per individual transfer.Account closure fees. Not all banks do this, but you may be charged a fee for closing your account. This is typically charged when you close it within a short timeframe, such as 90 or 180 days. The average fee is $25, but some banks can charge up to $50.Annual card fees. Many banks charge annual credit and debit card fees. You’ll be able to find a range of different card products; some with lower fees, but higher interest, or some with higher fees, but better annual reward offers, and similar. When it comes to cards, it all depends on what you need out of your card’s performance.Poor FX rates when transferring money. While not a fee per se, this still costs you money. Banks will typically use their own FX rate when transferring money, which normally include their hidden fees 'baked in'. As such, you may encounter rates that are less than ideal when transferring your international payments.Which bank do I choose?There are more than 5,000 different banks and savings institutions across the US, so as an outsider it can be daunting to choose the right one for your business. A good place to start is by trying the Big 4 major banks. These banks are typically set up to accommodate businesses, and offer a range of business bank account options.Bank of AmericaOne of the biggest US banks, the Bank of America has two business bank accounts to choose from. Both have a monthly fee, ranging from $16 to $30, but these can be waived if you maintain a $5,000 - $15,000 combined average monthly balance.CitibankA name many international businesses will know, Citibank has four business checking accounts to choose from. Available for businesses of all sizes, their individual fees range from $15 - $25 per month, which can be waived if you hold a minimum of $5,000 - $10,000 in your account. They have options for no-interest accounts, or interest-earning accounts, and provide merchant services to help businesses as they grow.JP Morgan ChaseJP Morgan Chase has three business banking options, designed for small, medium, and enterprise-level businesses. Their monthly service fees range from $15 - $95, but can be waived if you maintain a minimum daily balance of $35,000 - $95,000 or more. Given the higher end of the financial scale, these business bank accounts may be better served for larger organisations.Wells FargoWells Fargo has three bank account options for both small and commercial-sized businesses. Their fees range from $25 - $75 per month, and depending on the account these can be waived if you hold a daily balance of $500 - $10,000. Each account also features free-free transactions for your first 100-250 transactions, making it an attractive option for businesses looking to save money on their banking.A business banking alternative designed to grow with youAirwallex has you covered, empowering you to open a foreign currency account that you can use throughout the US—and the globe. Better still, get access to an account with no monthly fees.

Decisions requiring you to weigh up how to best use your capital, your time, and your effort. Understanding how each of these decisions can impact your bottom line, whether it’s immediately apparent or not, is critical in building a robust business.
This is where the idea of opportunity cost comes into play.What is opportunity cost? When you make a business decision, you’re choosing one outcome over another. You’re choosing to spend money on one thing over something else.
Opportunity cost is the effective difference in cost between the outcomes of both decisions. 
An opportunity cost formula provides you with a way to measure the difference between two decisions, as a way to land on a rough value figure of one option over the other. It enables you to work out the potential cost of missing out on the other opportunity when compared with the one you went with. Instead of weighing up theoretical pros and cons, you’re getting a more financially motivated, common-sense answer. What is negative opportunity cost?When making these decisions, you want to see that which decision is going to deliver the best financial outcome. So when you determine that the opportunity you’re potentially choosing is losing you more money than you’re likely to make, this is known as a negative opportunity cost.
Determining a negative opportunity cost can act as an early warning system for your investments, and help you avoid potentially costly mistakes.What is opportunity cost used for?As a business owner, it’s a quick way to measure the trade-off of one decision against another. It enables you to put a dollar figure against the risks and benefits of each option and calculate the difference in expected returns of your business decisions.The principles of calculating opportunity costs can be applied to a range of industries, and allows for more profitable decision-making. Effectively, determining the best bang for your buck.Opportunity cost formulaAs you can guess, calculating opportunity cost isn’t a quick process. It requires as much data and cost information as you can provide in order to get a realistic figure—but the value can be priceless. 
Monetary factors, such as cost of the asset, income generated from the asset, returns over time, are easier to calculate than intangible factors. So things like the amount of time invested into each asset, the effort taken to use it, or learn how to do so, or the skills required to undertake the option (which can, in turn, involve upskilling, training, and new hires).Here’s how to calculate the opportunity cost of your business decisions.Opportunity cost = Return on the next best option — return on the option you’re choosing
It sounds simple, in theory. But it’s working out the cost of each option that takes time.Related article: How to Calculate ROIBusiness owners make these sorts of decisions all the timeLet’s look at some examples of calculating opportunity cost in practice.
Say you’re a business owner looking for a new warehouse storage space. You’ve got two options, one is $1000/month more expensive than the other, but it’s a slightly larger size. Here you’re calculating the difference between the cost of each space itself, plus the potential sales from the stock stored within.
But it can also be more involved. Say you’re an electronics provider looking at options for growth. You’re weighing up the benefit of expanding into a new target market; for example, a group of new suburbs on the other side of town. You’re contemplating whether to look wider for growth, or to grow your existing market by boosting your marketing efforts in your current market.
Here you’d need to calculate what goes into each option. The increasing scope might include costs for market research, creation of new advertising, contracting an agency to undertake the advertising for you, and lead generation. Whereas doubling down at home requires more effort from your existing teams, couple with increased marketing spend, new advertising content, and more effort put into your upselling.
It can also be a long-term game. Let’s look at the example of a business owner with $50k in debt. You’re considering two options: you’re thinking about paying down the debt now, or alternatively, buying a new product manufacturing asset so you can increase your output, and use this to generate additional profit.In this circumstance, you’re weighing up the current debt, on which you’re paying interest—but also the mental impact it has as it hangs over your head—against the upfront cost of buying a new asset which will put you further in debt, but has the potential to over time bring in more revenue to help pay off the debt quicker.Opportunity cost can inform your growth plansAs you can see, it’s not always a clear-cut process. Opportunity cost can’t always be accurately or fully quantified at the time you make the decision. The best you can do is create an approximate estimate of the outcomesHowever, it can be a useful tool to help inform your growth plans, and has the potential to tell you whether an investment is likely to be positive or negative.
Calculating your opportunity cost goes a long way to helping you understand how you can best use finite resources like time and money.Airwallex is helping you make these decisions easierAs a business owner, you’re doing what you can with the resources you have available. You’re managing finite capital, and looking at ways to eliminate costs wherever possible.

However, there is only one area worth your obsession – your customers.""Customer obsession is something you need to think about over, and over, and over again… always be reflecting on how your product or experience will be received by your customers."" – Naomi SimsonThe topic of customer obsession continues to gain traction, and for a good reason. It’s critical to building loyal brand advocates, reaching new audiences (at a fraction of the cost), and ultimately, contributes to a thriving business. An obsessive focus on the customers is not only important for customer acquisition, but equally it drives retention.Despite customers being the lifeblood of any successful business, it’s often difficult for business leaders to truly develop a “customer-obsessed culture”. To understand more, we partnered with Naomi Simson, Founder of RedBalloon, and we're fortunate to speak with her about the topic of customer obsession and what guidance she gives to first time business owners and experienced leaders.What is customer obsession?First, it’s important to recognise that customer obsession exists on a spectrum, meaning that all businesses display some degree of customer obsession and the extent can shift over time depending on their people, principles and priorities.Most companies are customer focussed, meaning that they listen to what their customers say. However, the most successful companies deserve a separate category – what we call customer obsessed. Customer obsessed businesses not only listen to their customers, they put the customer at the heart of everything they do. It is a state of hyperfocus where the customer’s needs are prioritised in every business goal. Almost always, customer obsessed businesses use first-hand customer data to draw insights and actively respond to customer needs by making timely adjustments to how they deliver value. Importantly, it all begins with mindset. Here’s a quick overview to highlight the distinction:Often the barriers to customer obsession can be greater than mindset. This is why in the next section, we'll cover the most common blockers to look out for.Four key blockers to building a customer-obsessed culture1. Internal alignmentCustomer obsession requires every employee to recognise their role in delivering on the company’s mission. Business leaders must not only empower team members to make customer-first decisions, but also ensure this is recognised so the behaviour permeates the organisation. Often team members don’t see how their role connects to the customer experience, particularly in less visible functions such as a legal or finance function. Therefore, it’s important that leaders make this connection as clear as possible, ensuring internal alignment around the customer experience, so that the business can deliver on its commitment to customers.2. Data junkyardsWhen faced with a deluge of customer data and information, it can be hard to know what voices to listen to. Obtaining clarity on exactly who the customer is, and what voices matter, is critical when discerning what feedback is most important. Similarly, it’s important to get as close as possible to the unfiltered voice of the customer. By removing layers of communication, it can often be easier to distinguish the signal from the noise, and in turn make customer-first decisions.3. Biased toward our perspectiveWe all have cognitive and social biases that we bring to our decision making. For example, it's easy to place more emphasis on our own experience than see from another's point of view. As a founder or employee, your perspective of the company will be very different to that of your customer. Quickly reflect, are you the target customer for your product/service? If not, how can you get closer to the experience of your customer?4. Life happensIf you are in a start-up or scale-up phase, rapid growth can quickly turn into a million other tasks. Your time and energy can be focussed inwards (working in the business), upwards (working on the business), sideways (competition), or forward (customers). Taking 10 mins to colour code your diary for the week with four colours is a simple way to see where your time is really going:Coding your diary is an easy way to audit your time. Now for a quick audit of your priorities.Aligning customer and company prioritiesReflecting on how your priorities compare to the priorities of your customers can be a great way to gain further alignment.""List the ten things in your business that you think are the most important, and then ask yourself the question, 'Are those ten things the items that matter most to your customers?'"" – Naomi SimsonReflection: What are those ten things for you – and for your customers?Take the quiz: Are you building a customer-obsessed culture?Complete this short questionnaire to find out to what extent your business is customer obsessed: Building a customer obsession culture Fantastic, you’re hopefully clearer on to what extent your company culture is customer-obsessed. Now, let’s get ready to raise the bar.There are three steps to increase customer obsession in your organisation:Pause and be PresentPosition and PersonalisePinpoint and PerformStep 1: Pause and be PresentThe first step is to pause and be present. Naomi Simson calls this ""deep listening.""You're excited, a lot is going on, and you think that your product/service is the perfect solution to all your customer's problems. By pausing to listen, you open the door to really know your customer. Even in a digital-only business, a business is ultimately people supporting people.Pausing to listen can be challenging, and it is undoubtedly costly. Ultimately, it is your customers that are keeping your business afloat. So you can afford to give them the most expensive resources you have – time and attention.""This is one thing I do with founders [get them to deep listen] because they get so excited about themselves and what they're doing. While it is so important, there's only one really important person – that is the customer…We should be listening deeply at every opportunity to understand how the story you're sharing is landing with your customers."" – Naomi Simson Customer obsession starts with deep listening. At its heart, deep listening is listening to learn and understand from the customer, not ""listening"" to respond and inform the customer. Set up listening posts to gain customer feedback at every possible interaction the customer has with your brand. Listening posts can be a mixture of digital, for example, using online behaviour on your website or face-to-face, such as running a customer focus group to gain critical feedback before an important product launch. Action: What listening posts can you set up in your business?Step 2: Position and PersonaliseThe second step is to position and personalise.Most businesses recognise that positioning is critical to acquiring new customers but often make uninformed assumptions about what their customers care about. To position your business effectively, you need to know your customer journey, what drives decisions for your customers, and when your customers are in market for your product or service. This needs to be validated based on customer conversations and data, and should be iterated over time.Personalisation requires you to demonstrate that you know your customer well and directly speak to their desires and pain-points. Whether you’re selling a product or service, it’s important that you tailor your marketing and sales process based on the customer. To be customer obsessed means that the entire customer journey should be defined based on what you know about the customer.Action: If you haven't already, map out your customer journey. You may have several journeys. How can your interaction with the customer be personalised?Step 3: Pinpoint and PerformThe third step is to pinpoint and perform. This step is about enabling and rewarding a culture of customer obsession, which can be achieved by clearly defining aspiration goals that your people can get behind.""Find a metric that everybody can get behind. We're all in business to make a difference to other human beings. So when you attach that number to a human element, then it's exciting for people."" – Naomi SimsonFor RedBalloon, Naomi provides a practical example: the number of experiences sold. For each experience sold, there are at least two people who had an interaction with the RedBalloon brand: the experience buyer and seller. This critical metric is a visual reminder for everyone in the business that their role, whether directly facing the customer or not, is all part of the customer experience. In your internal communications, articulating where each department impacts the customer journey can be powerful. The metric becomes an anchor point to start building a culture of customer obsession.Action: What is your aspirational customer obsession metric that everyone can get behind?Achieving customer obsessionYour customers are the most important factor to the success and viability of your business. No customers = no business. Of course, not all businesses have budgets like Amazon or Netflix, however, companies such as these set the bar for what customers expect, and customers bring these expectations to your business.As you think about how to become customer here's a quick recap:Pause and be presentPosition and personalisePinpoint and performWell done! You are now well on your way to being customer obsessed.Related article: 4 Habits of Highly Successful eCommerce BusinessesBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/beautifying-b2b-sales-qwilrs-us-expansion,Beautifying B2B sales: Qwilr’s US expansion,"BlogBeautifying B2B sales: Qwilr’s US expansion26 July 2021•4 minsCustomer storiesTechnologyStart-ups“Qwilr’s secret sauce is enabling businesses to present themselves in a really beautiful way.” – Tania Clarke, Product Marketing LeadStanding out from the crowd can be tough. Qwilr makes it easy to create differentiated, visually compelling sales and marketing collateral, at speed. Sales teams are able to deliver a better, faster buyer experience by combining proposal content, price quotes and sales transactions into a single, mobile-friendly webpage. It’s the ultimate productivity boost for sales and marketing teams, with automation, analytics, code-free design and collaboration capability, all in one platform.Founded in 2014 by Dylan Baskind and Mark Tanner, Qwilr was an international business from the first day. One of its first customers was in New Zealand, and the viral nature of the product meant very quickly they had new customers from the US and UK to the Netherlands and Germany. Qwilr has a grand mission of liberating the power of the web – bringing the best of the sales process found in e-commerce to business-to-business (B2B) sales. Qwilr also has staff in the Philippines, Ukraine, Greece, United States, and United Kingdom in addition to their home in Australia. From day one, the company has been global, operating with remote work practices and designing a remote sales product for sales teams.QWILR CO-FOUNDERS (LEFT TO RIGHT) DYLAN BASKIND, MARK TANNER. SOURCE: SUPPLIED.“Sales teams needed a way to fast track their remote selling processes when COVID-19 first started to unfold. And Qwilr was ideal for this global gear switch.” – Tania Clarke, Product Marketing LeadLast year, Qwilr raised $10.8 million in Series A funding, an investment to boost Qwilr’s international presence in the US and Europe. Part of laying the groundwork for the next phase of international growth was setting up a US subsidiary. Despite several challenges, Adam Ingles, Finance Manager, says that establishing Qwilr formally in the US market has been a game-changer for its employees, customers and suppliers.QWILR TEAM CELEBRATING THEIR SERIES A RAISE.“The US can be a tricky country to do business with from a finance and legal perspective. Spending money on good advice can save lots of trouble in the long run.” – Adam Ingles, Finance ManagerManaging foreign exchange volatility is another aspect of running a global business like Qwilr. Particularly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign exchange rates were unstable, making it incredibly hard for Adam and his team to forecast. Using Airwallex, Qwilr could receive customer payments in USD and start paying suppliers in USD.“Airwallex made things easier to forecast because we didn’t need to worry about exchange rate differences…we could start to build up our own reserves of USD.” – Adam Ingles, Finance ManagerQwilr worked closely with its investors and advisors to smooth the path of international expansion. Adam is emphatic in his advice to other businesses looking to expand internationally. “Do not attempt to do it yourself!” Instead, he believes it is essential to invest in getting the right advice from the right people. It's an exciting time for Qwilr as it grows its share in key markets internationally. Tania Clarke joins as the Product Marketing Lead to take Qwilr’s product marketing function to the next stage of maturity. With experience at start-up giants such as SafetyCulture and Atlassian under her belt, Tania is testing new positioning and go-to-market channels. Tania is particularly aware to ensure that messaging to Qwilr’s target market remains consistent and tailored to their operating regions.“Being an Aussie-owned company, it is quite easy to think Australia is the default business market. Expanding the talent pool in the US broadens our GTM perspective. ” – Tania Clarke, Product Marketing LeadTania’s advice to other businesses looking to expand internationally is to ensure that their feedback is representative of their “best customers”, those that are most willing to pay and support your business. For Qwilr, that looks like seeking input from B2B sales teams in multiple markets and industries.  An international customer base means being able to invoice in more than one currency becomes important. Qwilr has solved this issue in a cost-effective way with Airwallex's Global Accounts. In addition, Airwallex’s Foreign Currency Accounts enable Qwilr’s sales team to start doing deals in other currencies. Since Qwilr has moved to use Airwallex, it has saved thousands a month on foreign exchange fees.Managing the organisation’s finances across five countries has required the use of innovative technology solutions. Using Airwallex’s virtual debit cards has meant that Adam has been able to gain better control on the cards, saving time in monitoring and managing expenses. Previously, Adam would be spending hours on the phone with the bank to get corporate cards for their business and then tracking down where expenses came from. Now, he can open up the Airwallex app and sign in to have visibility and control at his fingertips. In addition, different cards for different departments mean that the end-of-month reconciliation is a smoother process.For other global tech businesses like Qwilr, giving Airwallex a go is virtually risk-free.""You’re crazy not to try Airwallex, especially if you are dealing with foreign currencies. It is easy to sign up, get verified, and test it with little risk. Especially if you are dealing in foreign currency and getting hurt by FX rates and foreign currency fees.” – Adam Ingles, Finance ManagerQwilr’s sights are now set on honing their product and target market. Its staff base is growing rapidly to strategically position themselves in the US and Europe. Qwilr is also looking to build new features that meet the market needs and enable it to stand out from its competition. Which is exactly what Qwilr can do for your business.--

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-calculate-roi,How to Calculate ROI: It’s Not as Hard as You Think,"BlogHow to Calculate ROI: It’s Not as Hard as You ThinkJoe Romeo9 July 2021•7 minutesFinanceIn this article•Calculate return on investment•So, what is ROI?•How to calculate ROI•How to calculate ROI on your marketing spend•Some useful tips for improving ROI•Discover how Airwallex uses better banking to help you improve your ROICalculate return on investmentWe’ve all heard and probably used, the term ROI. We know that it stands for Return on Investment. But what exactly is Return on Investment?In this article, we’re going to look at what ROI is, how to calculate ROI for your business, your marketing, and provide you with a simple ROI calculator you can use for your business.So, what is ROI?ROI is a calculation that’s commonly used to measure the financial return you’ll receive from the money you’re investing into something. It’s the count or multiplier of how many dollars you get back for every dollar you put in. Essentially, you’re creating a clear snapshot to determine whether or not the investment is worth it.How to calculate your ROI is actually reasonably simple, and as such, has made this metric a universally understood measurement of the profitability of your potential investments.ROI is different to simple profitProfit is the financial figure you arrive at after subtracting your expenses from your income. Instead, calculating ROI allows you to measure the effectiveness of your potential investment.What is considered a good ROI?What determines a good ROI really depends on what your business is looking to achieve, and the investments you’re considering. Simply put, though, if you calculate your ROI and it comes back with a positive figure, then it’s likely a good investment to look into. You can use this figure to compare different investments and see which is likely to deliver the better return. If your ROI calculation returns a negative result, then this implies the investment is going to make a loss for your business, and you know to stay away from it.ROI does have its limitsWhile calculating ROI is an easy way to get a quick idea of the value of an investment, it’s not appropriate in all circumstances.For example, if you perform free marketing activities that earn you income, such as through an organic social media post or running a free online webinar (well, arguably free—we’re not including time in this) then your ROI is effectively 0%. 0% ROI would usually be a bad outcome, but in this case, it doesn’t portray the full picture.So ROI is typically reserved for investments with clear monetary sums.How to calculate ROICalculate ROI yourself using this simple formulaThere are a few different formulas you can use yourself to easily calculate the ROI of purchases for your business. However, we’ve included the one that’s easiest to use and to understand.(Net income earned from the investment / Cost of investment) x 100%How to calculate ROI on your marketing spendMarketing spend is one of the most common ROI calculations used for businesses. So let’s look at an example.Say your business spends or is looking to spend, $1,000 a month on your marketing, across your social and online channels. This includes social media ads, pay-per-click ads, and the like.From this $1,000 spend, your monthly campaign ends up generating $10,000 in revenue.Using the ROI formula: ($10,000 / $1,000) x 100% = ROI of 1,000%
So for every dollar you spend on your marketing you’re seeing $10 in profit.But what if you’re looking at the ROI on marketing leads?You spend $1,000 on a lead generation campaign. During this campaign you generate 100 new leads. This means that you’re spending $10 for every lead.Your business makes on average $2,000 from each customer.If you convert 3% of these new leads into customers (which is admittedly just 3 new customers), at $2,000 income each, that’s a return of $6,000($6,000 / $1,000) x 100% = ROI of 600%Some useful tips for improving ROIOutside of choosing the right assets and avenues for investment, improving your ROI comes down to refining how and what you sell.Audit your sales processAssessing your sales pipeline from start to finish lets you determine where your marketing processes may be holding you back.It could be as simple as adding a new call to action button onto a sales landing page. After all, it’s been proven that a well-written, targeted call-to-action can convert 202% better than a generic ‘Buy now’-style button. Or, it could be as wide-reaching as overhauling your entire sales funnel, and looking at where you’re putting your marketing spend. For example, paid channels like Facebook and Google are usually proven to be the platforms with the best ROI. Is your business making the most of these channels?Review your sales contentFollowing on from your sales process, ensuring you have the right sales content in place can make all the difference to your sales process.And these days it’s not just words—what about video? In a 2020 study, 83% of marketers surveyed found that video content has helped them generate leads. In the same survey, 84% of consumers surveyed said that a well-produced brand video had convinced them to buy a product.So changing the type of sales content you use in your sales funnel can make a huge difference to your ROI.Cut out unnecessary costs in your budgetOne of the biggest ways to improve your ROI is to cut back on all unnecessary costs. This may take some time, but it can make a huge difference. For example, you might look into finding a cheaper provider for the product you’re looking to sell. Or, if you’re looking at your marketing holistically, it could be finding a more cost-effective internet provider, or sales platform.It can also mean looking at how you make your purchases and payments. You’re most likely getting slugged with unnecessary costs simply for doing your banking. Fees such as excessive FX and international transaction costs, high bank accounts fees, and other similar expenses.Luckily, there’s a way to cut these costs for good.Discover how Airwallex uses better banking to help you improve your ROIAt Airwallex we make it easy for you to break free of the limitations imposed by the big banks, with a range of better products that ensure you reduce the fees you pay for your banking. A simple fix like this ensures you get much better ROI when making your payments.

I decided to build a digital solution. One online platform where you can register a company and manage all the time-consuming and boring pieces."" Adrien Barthel, Sleek Co-FounderSleek is an online platform that assists anyone, anywhere, to register a company in Hong Kong and Singapore. By automating and digitising corporate services, Sleek works with a vast network of partner organisations to assist their clients in streamlining their legal, financial and governance setup.SLEEK CO-FOUNDERS (LEFT TO RIGHT) ADRIEN BARTHEL, JULIEN LABRUYERE. SOURCE: SUPPLIED.Adrien Barthel, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at Sleek, shares Sleek's growth story and his insights into international growth. Having operated in the Southeast Asia e-commerce sector for over ten years, Adrien is no stranger to working with company secretaries and accountants and found that operations continued in a very traditional manner.""I had a eureka moment the day I read the Companies Act of Singapore. I also read the Electronic Transaction Act, which says we could be using digital signatures for governance operations… I told my company secretary, and he looked at me and told me, 'ok, you're 30 years old, and I've been in the business for 40 years. Just stick to my rules and processes, or the door is just there.' So I took the door knowing that we could be digitising everything."" Adrien Barthel, Sleek Co-FounderAdrien reached out to his network to find out their experience working with corporate service providers. There are over 9,000 corporate services companies in Hong Kong and Singapore. Each person was frustrated with the pace and paper involved. Starting in April 2017, Sleek has modernised corporate services for more than 5,000+ businesses.THE TEAM BEHIND SLEEK’S DIGITAL FIRST CORPORATE SECRETARY, INCORPORATION AND ACCOUNTING SERVICES. SOURCE: SUPPLIED.Sleek's approach to modernising the industry can be seen in its transparent pricing structure. Adrien likes to think of this as more of an ""all you can eat"" style arrangement with an annual flat fee. Other service providers have more of an ""a la carte"" arrangement, where complex solutions go up in price. As Sleek's packages are simple and straightforward, the decision for the 
entrepreneur is clear.Transitioning from traditional to digital: challenging the status quoThe biggest challenge Sleek overcame in 2017 was how entrenched mindsets were. Regulated industries were the most risk-averse and tend to favour traditional, slower, paper-based processes. On the other hand, Sleek redesigned the processes to be more innovative, faster and digital. In the early stages of growth, the difference was so stark that Sleek found their clients questioning whether their processes were legal. Particularly for established organisations, transitioning from paper-based compliance to digital compliance can require significant mindset and systems change. Thankfully, Sleek has a dedicated client base who have been their biggest advocates. Sleek has seen massive growth from word-of-mouth referrals because of the trust that is developed. Compared to the past, today, many clients expect digital first which Sleek had successfully pioneered.Client feedback is key to successAdrien reminds founders to stay close to the frontline for any businesses looking to expand internationally and ""speak to your clients often!"". Adrien is acutely aware that as businesses scale, founders can lose touch and must prioritise client feedback. Sleek runs focus groups every month and quarterly surveys, and their customer success team provides constant feedback to help improve the product and service. ""I couldn't be more thankful for the clients' brutal honesty.""Airwallex integral to Sleek's one-stop solutionAirwallex has played a critical role in Sleek's Hong Kong growth story. ""If you're not in Hong Kong, it's not possible to open a local bank account. For locally based individuals, it can take two months."" To set up an online business account with Airwallex takes a fraction of the time. Sleek's clients use Airwallex to collect, hold and pay between Hong Kong and other countries. In particular, Airwallex is beneficial to businesses that need a multi-currency business account, such as those with customers or suppliers from around the world.For Sleek, the efficiency and seamlessness of the process is a winner. Some clients prefer to go to more traditional banks, however, several forms and three weeks in, they come back to Sleek for a Plan B, and that's when Sleek directs them to Airwallex to set up a more efficient, online business account.The digital dreamThe primary focus for Sleek is improving its products and services. There is a continuous release of improvements on existing services and the introduction of new services that complement the work they're already doing, like in the company secretary space.
The second focus is international expansion. Sleek is considering other Commonwealth markets. The vision is that in five years, an entrepreneur, anywhere in the world, will be able to set up their own company efficiently and transparently. Without paper.--

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/legal-considerations-before-expanding-overseas,What Are My Legal Considerations Before Expanding Overseas?,"BlogWhat Are My Legal Considerations Before Expanding Overseas?28 June 2021•6 minutesFinanceIn this article•What Business Structure Will You Use?•What will be taxed?•No foreign company or permanent establishment•Do You Have to Localise Your Product or Service?•How Will You Deliver Your Product or Service?•Key Takeaways•Frequently Asked QuestionsBy: Sian McLachlan, Senior Lawyer, LegalVision.If you have successfully proven your product in Australia, it may be time to look beyond our borders. Overseas markets present a huge growth opportunity. However, there are several elements to consider before you start jet-setting. Expanding overseas is not as simple as replicating what you have done in Australia. Different laws apply in different countries. As a result, there are different legal hurdles to navigate. This article will set out the legal issues you should consider before expanding overseas, including your tax, employees and customers.What Business Structure Will You Use?For most businesses, the primary consideration in deciding whether to expand overseas is whether the unit economics make sense. Will you make more money selling your products or services overseas rather than expanding nationally? To make this decision, you need to know your expected profit. To do so, you will need to know how much you will be taxed. How much you will be taxed depends on which business structure you choose.What Are the Options?Different countries tax businesses differently. Therefore, different business structures suit business operations in different countries. The table below outlines several options to consider when choosing how to expand your business.What will be taxed?Foreign company (e.g. subsidiary of your Australian company)If you set up a company in another country, everything that the company does will likely be taxed in that country. This may be a great outcome if the tax rate is lower in that country. However, if the tax rate is higher in that country, you might prefer a different business structure. Permanent establishmentYou might create a permanent establishment in a foreign country, depending on your type of operations. For example, you might have an office or a warehouse in a foreign country. This means you have a permanent establishment in that country. What amounts to a permanent establishment depends on the circumstances. If you have a permanent establishment in a foreign country, all things attributable to your business in that country will likely be taxed there (rather than in Australia). Therefore, you need to have processes in place for determining what is and is not attributable to the business in that foreign country. This can be a high administrative cost.No foreign company or permanent establishmentWhether this is possible depends on your operations. For example, suppose you have a warehouse or use a contractor in a foreign country. In that case, it might not be possible for you to avoid having a permanent establishment in that foreign country. You should speak to a tax lawyer about your operations to determine whether this is possible. If you do not have a company or permanent establishment in the foreign country, you will have more options to limit taxed profits in that foreign country.
Do You Have to Localise Your Product or Service?Not all consumers are the same - especially consumers in different countries. Depending on what is popular and culturally acceptable in that country, you may have to modify your product or service offering. If you change your product or service, consider whether you need to make any changes to your legal documents.What Legal Documents Do I Need?If you change your product or service to suit the local market, you may need to change your customer documents. These include your terms of use, terms and conditions or client service agreements. You should tailor these documents to suit your product or service. They will also likely contain provisions that address specific Australian laws. For example, such documents may contain provisions dealing with GST or Australian consumer laws. You should also speak to your lawyer and ask whether any changes need to be made, before making these documents available to customers in foreign countries. How Will You Deliver Your Product or Service?One of the most significant hurdles in expanding overseas is organising your supply chain. If you are a wholly online service, this may be less of an issue. However, if you need to deliver any physical product or service, you need to think about execution. If your business involves physically delivering products, you might need to engage distributors in the foreign country. You might even need to set up a warehouse. This can have tax implications, as discussed above. Additionally, you will need to have contracts in place with people who can assist with transport and delivery. It is not simply a matter of having those foreign distributors sign your Australian contracts. You should update these contracts to address the local legal risks and requirements. If your business involves physical service delivery, will you be engaging employees or contractors in the foreign country? If so, you will need employment or contractor agreements for those people. Again, you should update your Australian template documents to reflect the risks and laws of the relevant country. Warning: Employment laws vary hugely in different countries. It is best practice to get legal advice before you engage workers in foreign countries. This will ensure you do not fall foul of any particular legal requirements. Key TakeawaysBefore deciding to expand overseas, you should consider:what business structure you will use. Different business structures are more suited to different countries and different business operations;whether you need to localise your product or service offering. If so, you might need to update your customer documents; and how you will deliver your product or service. You will need different contracts in place with your distributors and workers. How you deliver your products may also have tax implications.If you have any questions about expanding overseas, LegalVision’s experienced business lawyers can help. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat business structure is best suited for overseas expansion?Your business structure will depend on the country, your business operations and how different countries tax businesses. Therefore, the business structure you choose for your overseas business will depend on your goals for expansion, the nature of your business and the type of operations. 
Will I need to update my contracts?It is best practice to update your business contracts, including any consumer and employment contracts for your overseas business. You should avoid cutting corners and simply letting foreign distributors, for example, sign your Australian contracts. Expanding business overseas requires updating your business contracts to address the local legal risks and requirements. Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/building-a-culture-of-compliance-that-empowers-businesses-grow,How we are building a culture of compliance that empowers businesses to grow without borders,"BlogHow we are building a culture of compliance that empowers businesses to grow without borders22 June 2021•6 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•Compliance in an evolving environment•Building a compliance culture from the ground up By Jeanette Chan, Chief Legal, Compliance and Risk Officer, Chong Yi, Director of Compliance, NA and EMEA and Jennifer Thomas, Senior Licensing and Regulatory Manager at AirwallexIn part one of our compliance blog series, we explored how compliance protects our customers and their transactions through a global network of dedicated legal and compliance experts. However, our commitment to security and compliance doesn’t stop at our customers. Our global legal and compliance team is dedicated to not only upholding regulations across all the regions we operate in, but also building compliance into every facet of our business. From product and engineering, to business development and marketing, we put compliance at the heart and centre of everything we do. Compliance in an evolving environmentThere is often a misperception that the compliance function is counterproductive and the compliance team acts as a barrier to innovation. Within an organisation, the compliance department is often misunderstood and is seen to be unimaginative, and whose first reaction to ideas and requests is a resounding no, impeding the organisation from achieving its commercial business objectives. Initially, most organisations see their compliance efforts as a matter of ‘checking the boxes’ to avoid the risk of penalties and reputational damage.However, the evolution of compliance can be seen today as a competitive advantage and an indispensable component not only to meet regulatory requirements but also for innovation, for business growth, and for adding value holistically to the changing environment. At Airwallex, the compliance team understands the importance of its role as a business partner to both internal teams and external stakeholders. Therefore, our approach to compliance is unique and deeply rooted in our culture. Having the program built-in means we can create seamless workflows for employees, whilst still upholding customer and investor confidence through our robust security and compliance measures.Building a compliance culture from the ground up We take a data and knowledge-first approach. We use data analysis and reporting to improve the quality of business decisions and our wider compliance strategy. Before launching any new compliance procedure, we perform tests using data to critically assess output accuracy, consistency of deliverables and potential impact on service level agreements (already in place). Internal testing is rigorous, continuous, and transparent. New compliance processes will only be implemented after taking into consideration their impact on efficiency, the quality of compliance and the effect on ultimate customer experience. Balancing all those factors is an important component of any new process being considered. We strike a balance between agility and compliance. The greatest challenge for compliance is to keep up with change. Working across multiple markets and jurisdictions means our compliance program is designed to adjust to the changing regulatory environment, while ensuring we remain consistent and compliant across regions. Having local teams allows us to better navigate each market and jurisdiction we operate in, while also recognising cultural, geographical and language barriers. Safe to say, we are constantly enacting, enforcing and evolving the way we work to ensure we are proactively addressing the business’ compliance needs. We take an active approach to building awareness and education. Understanding the role of compliance and how it enables operations globally is essential. Successful company-wide understanding hinges on the strength of employee training initiatives at all levels. This starts at the very beginning with our onboarding process, where every employee undertakes comprehensive training on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing to understand the role compliance plays in keeping Airwallex operational and secure. We also use internal messaging and support channels to foster an ongoing dialogue on compliance. All employees are encouraged to freely contact our compliance team - anonymously or otherwise - with any questions or concerns they may have. In addition, the training ensures our compliance officers understand our customers and the unique challenges they face. We ensure meaningful engagements with regulators. New tech solutions and digital businesses have rapidly expanded the global economy. In this new environment, regulator’s scrutiny has become critical. This explains why Airwallex has built an open and continuous dialogue with regulators. We work in partnership with governing bodies to maintain our status as an industry leader - both in terms of creative solutions for, and protection of, our customers. We ensure compliance remains a core value of the business. For compliance to take root in an organisation’s culture, it has to start from the top. At Airwallex, the leadership team is committed to constantly reinforce the value and the important role compliance plays to sustain our business long-term. This means we celebrate successes but also constantly strive for improvement to ensure we remain fully compliant across the business. Compliance plays an integral role at Airwallex. It ensures we abide by internal rules of conduct and external rules and regulations, but also that we operate in an ethical and responsible way. By creating policies that are both comprehensive and flexible, our compliance strategy is always relevant to the evolving needs of our customers, regulators and broader stakeholders, and is aligned with the wider business vision to empower businesses to operate anywhere, anytime. Related article: How we are keeping abreast of changes in the world of economic sanctionsBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/employee-airtime-with-ivo-jenni-product-lead-based-in-shanghai,"Employee Airtime with Ivo Jenni, Product Lead based in Shanghai","BlogEmployee Airtime with Ivo Jenni, Product Lead based in Shanghai18 June 2021•6 minutesWelcome to Employee Airtime! In this content series, we sit down with our talented team to talk about why they're excited to work at Airwallex, their passions and what gets them out of bed in the morning! Introducing Ivo Jenni, Product Lead based in Shanghai. How did you get into tech?As a young boy growing up in a small farmers’ village in Switzerland, I was immediately fascinated when I accessed the Internet for the very first time. It was as if a window had suddenly opened to a bigger world that offered endless things to explore. Soon, I became curious about website development and dabbled in it, and at 16, I started taking on small projects as a freelance developer. Initially my skill set was very limited and I spent hours searching for ways to solve all sorts of issues. But eventually the hard work paid off and I learned how to build new websites more systematically. I remember building a simple event management system for the local music school in our town and feeling very proud when I saw the first tickets being booked through it. At that time, I didn’t have any grand ambition and was mainly looking to gain some extra pocket money to attend a music festival. Never did I expect this to be the start of my career path.Why did you choose Airwallex?Firstly, I have always been interested in the fintech industry. Every business, big or small, and whatever industry it is in, still has to rely on financial services for its underlying operations – be it receiving money, paying their bills, taking out loans, or paying employees. Yet, such an essential part of our economy has an incredible amount of unsolved issues and businesses often settle for cumbersome products that charge high and unnecessary fees. While the issues within financial services are incredibly hard to solve, they also create  tremendous opportunities for companies that dare to tackle these challenges and build better solutions, such as Airwallex. Secondly, throughout my career, I’ve found being surrounded by people you can learn from is the number one most important thing for personal development. And that is what stood out at Airwallex – it boasts an incredibly talented team. Our team is truly global and diverse. Coming from different backgrounds, we each bring our own unique perspective and thinking to a problem, which helps us to continuously push the limits of our industry. We work hard but also have a lot of fun. As an ambitious team in a high-growth startup, we spend a lot of time at work and with colleagues, so having fun together is super important to me!Team Building in JixiWhat has been your proudest moment at Airwallex?During my 16 months at Airwallex there have been many achievements worth celebrating. We launched new products, expanded to new countries, won landmark customer deals, and solved many complex problems along the way. Yet when you ask me about my proudest moments, I immediately think about the future and moments that are yet to come. For example, we are currently building some exciting new products for our customers that are unlike anything in the market. Seeing the customer’s reaction when they use it for the first time will make me extremely proud.  We are also rapidly expanding our team, and I'm looking forward to seeing our new team members thrive in their roles and grow roots in the company. Seeing them realise their own ideas at Airwallex will fill me with even more pride than for my own achievements. I can’t wait for that!What is your advice for anyone looking to join a high-growth startup?First of all, I encourage everyone to make the jump! Working at a fast growing startup is one of the most exciting things you will do in your career.When looking at startups, many tend to look for positions with trendy job titles. As a result, the complicated and detailed work behind executing a bold idea and building a great product is often overlooked - but this is where the magic happens! I highly recommend you also explore opportunities in the many behind-the-scenes areas of a startup, like operations, infrastructure, risk management and others. They are the backbone of any great user experience a startup is looking to build. Additionally, these areas are where we find the biggest unsolved issues that help to provide a better service and experience for the customer. These areas often have a very steep learning curve, presenting many opportunities for personal growth and to make a significant impact to the company’s success.What do you do in your spare time?I love to spend time with friends and to get out of the city to clear my mind. Last year, I discovered mountaineering and fell in love with it. To me, mountaineering is both an exciting challenge and a peaceful retreat at the same time.So far, I have climbed two mountains above 5,000m in China – Nama Feng in Sichuan and Yuzhu Feng in Qinghai. At Nama Feng, we spent four days hiking and climbing, and three days going back down. The summit seemed impossibly far at first, but with the support of a great team, we focused on taking one step after the other and eventually we made it to the peak! Climbing Nama Feng, 5588m above sea levelTell us about your experience learning Chinese over the past six years.Chinese is hard and I still have so much to learn! I find that learning a language has a lot of similarities with building a great career. At the end of the day, it comes down to:Taking it one step at a time and never giving upFinding an environment where you are not afraid to make mistakes and can learn from the people around youAnd of course, having fun along the way!Working in LijiangBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-best-d2c-platforms-for-international-ecommerce,The best D2C platforms for international eCommerce,"BlogThe best D2C platforms for international eCommerce10 June 2021•7 minsE-commerceGuidesIn this article•The importance of D2C•What is a D2C Platform?•What should one look for in a great eCommerce platform?•Best D2C eCommerce Platforms•How to get started in D2C?•How does Airwallex help D2C eCommerce go global? The importance of D2CIn recent years, even the most tech-adverse among us have embraced shopping platforms like Shopify, Woocommerce, Magento and others to easily shop online. This surge has been especially strong since last year, during which the COVID-19 pandemic caused many people to stay at home. A recent study revealed that eCommerce growth was up over 80% year over year in the first 8 weeks of the pandemic. Many consumers who had never shopped online before discovered the convenience and ease of having goods delivered directly to your door. This has created a new market for online shoppers that many eCommerce retailers are eager to seize. What is a D2C Platform?D2C or direct-to-consumer platforms allow enterprises to market and sell their products directly to their customers, eliminating the need for any intermediaries. The difference between B2C and D2C is that in B2C, manufacturers usually rely on retailers (like Amazon) to sell their products. With research suggesting that 55% of consumers prefer to shop directly from brand manufacturers over retailers, it’s not difficult to understand why D2C is dominating the market. What should one look for in a great eCommerce platform?1. Access to international markets If you want to create a globally equipped eCommerce site, your D2C platform needs to be compatible with your target countries. A great D2C platform has access to international markets as well as a presence among the customer demographics in those different countries. eCommerce platforms make money when their customers make money. Therefore, the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of an eCommerce platform indicates its current market size and how well the customers’ businesses are flourishing. Shopify, for example, has merchants in 175 nations and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of US$175.4 billion internationally as of 2021. 2. Powerful add-ons and integrationsThe top eCommerce platforms usually have a dedicated app store supporting more than 1,000 third-party integrations, plugins, and extensions. These integrations and plugins make it possible to streamline your orders, shipping, promotions and user experience with automation and require little to no management. Magneto has the ability to communicate with over 140 API integrations, making the manufacturer-to-consumer transaction easier. 3. AffordabilityThere isn’t a one-size-fits-all to how much it would cost to build and host an eCommerce website. At the lower end, eCommerce platforms offer services starting from USD 20 to USD 30 a month. A custom eCommerce system may cost around USD 300 per month. Depending on your choice of the shipping carrier, your cost of shipping will vary. Additionally, eCommerce platforms also charge transaction fees and credit card rates. Therefore, analyse if a D2C platform charges any hidden fees after you subscribe to their service. Now that you understand how to pick the best eCommerce platform for your business, here are the top three best online selling sites in Australia. Best D2C eCommerce PlatformsShopifyPerhaps the most recognizable eCommerce platform, Shopify is the largest eCommerce-only platform with more than 1 million merchants in 175 countries, with a reported GMV of US$175.4 billion in 2021. It supports multiple languages and lets you ship your products to around 133 countries.The platform provides small and medium-sized businesses with powerful back-office functions and a single overview of their transactions, making every aspect easy to manage and update. Shopify is also used by big names such as Tesla, Budweiser, Red Bull and the New York Stock Exchange. It is highly flexible and user-friendly, with more than 3000 third-party integration and plugins available. It has an intuitive dashboard that makes it easy to manage and control your store without any technical knowledge.To open up international storefronts, you will either have to get a different domain or create a subdomain for each region.  If you plan to sell your products in more than a handful of countries, go for Shopify Plus.WooCommerceWooCommerce is a WordPress plugin that powers 28% of all online stores. WooCommerce’s GMV passed USD 11.8 billion in 2019. It offers 750 extensions and 81 payment gateways that you can choose from and integrate with, including choices like PayPal, Google Pay, Stripe, AmazonPay, Square, and Apple Pay. It’s notably easy to use and manage, as well as cost-efficient. There is no cost to use the platform, although the additional paid features are worth the investment. The paid plugins and add-ons, such as one-page checkout, automated email marketing through MailChimp and translation services, are a great value add.Magento (Adobe Commerce)Finally, Magento is another eCommerce platform that offers full customisability and a range of solutions for businesses of different sizes and industries. Parent company Adobe Inc reported strong 5% year on year growth to USD $826 million for 2020’s fiscal second quarter for its digital experience segment, which includes Magento.While Magento powers only about 1% of all top global CMS (Content Management Systems) sites, it is used by many high-end and multinational companies like Bulgari, Land Rover and Fred Perry.What platform should you use?The global platform your D2C eCommerce store decides to choose depends largely on your needs, goals and technical abilities. WooCommerce is ideal for WordPress-based eCommerce websites. WooCommerce is ideal for those D2C manufacturers that are comfortable working with WordPress and want to minimize expenses on their shopping platform. Shopify, however, is ideal for those entrepreneurs who don’t want to spend a large amount of time dealing with the technical aspects of setting up an online store. Shopify is easy to use and offers a high level of customer support, which could be helpful for first time eCommerce stores in the eCommerce realm. Of course, this comes with a price and a higher monthly subscription fee, depending on the services used. Magento is perfectly tailored for developers who want to have the freedom to add their code and tweaks to their website pages without being restricted to a predetermined template or layout. It’s also a good choice for companies that have professional web developers on the payroll because the platform is highly customizable for those with coding skills.How to get started in D2C?Before you choose the ideal shopping platform for your D2C business, it’s important to first take these important steps to get started in the eCommerce industry.Do market researchIt can be challenging to completely revamp your existing technology, services and products to fit the needs of your domestic market. Thankfully, international trade has become easier than ever due to eCommerce.Today, the international trading market is the most liquid asset market in the world, with a total value seventeen times greater in 2019 than global GDP. International expansion has never been simpler, and the opportunities are ample. Identify the most valuable market for the product or service you currently offer and go from there. Today it is relatively easy to create a website and arrange marketing, shipping and payment options for your ideal customer demographic. Validate new markets with test launchesOf course, the biggest mistake you can make as an entrepreneur is investing a lot of money and time into an idea that is doomed from the beginning. Through low-cost experimentation, you can roll out soft launches of your product in your target market to understand how your brand resonates with consumers, and adapt accordingly.How does Airwallex help D2C eCommerce go global? Airwallex helps D2C eCommerce businesses be international from day one with a truly global business account. Airwallex achieves this by making it seamless for you to collect, hold, convert and pay in your currency of choice - without the expensive FX fees.To put things into context, your FX fees could add up to $5,000 on a $100,000 international transaction. $5,000 that you could be re-investing into growing your business.This happens where most major banks charge an average of 3 - 5% on FX, as compared to Airwallex is as low as 0.3% on major currencies.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/xero-best-practices-for-ecommerce-businesses,Xero Best Practices for eCommerce Businesses,"BlogXero Best Practices for eCommerce Businesses8 June 2021•4 minsE-commerceIn this article•Separate your business and personal banking and transactions•Configure your chart of accounts in Xero•Set up a monthly bookkeeping system•Reconcile transactions in Xero •Managing Foreign Currency receivable and payables•Inventory•Other considerations Accounting software, like Xero, helps small businesses simplify and automate many everyday bookkeeping and accounting tasks to save them time. Xero allows businesses to automate invoicing, generate necessary reports, monitor their business’s profit and cash flow, facilitate tax preparations, and more.   However, you need to ensure your accounting software is set up and customized to your business’s needs to get the most out of it. In this post, we’re sharing six best practices for eCommerce businesses to get the most out of Xero.Separate your business and personal banking and transactionsKeeping track of your business and personal expenses, spending, and deposits in a spreadsheet may not be sufficient when running an eCommerce business. Additionally, as your business grows, using the same bank account for personal and business transactions can cost you more time and energy. It also can potentially lead to mistakes when you need to provide separate accounts of the information. Monitoring and understanding the flow of your business’s cash and transactions is critical to evaluating your business’s success and ensuring you can pay all bills and expenses on time. Keeping your business’s banking separate will make that process easier for you. Additional reasons to keep your business’s banking and transactions separate from your personal banking include: Accurately monitoring your business’s spending, money flow, and deposits Providing you with a clean record of your business transactions to give your accountant or use yourself when preparing your business’s taxesIf you engage an external bookkeeper it will be clear that all transactions are business relatedMaking it easier to provide the necessary information if the tax authority audits your business Configure your chart of accounts in XeroYou use Xero’s chart of accounts to categorize and record your company’s transactions. This system allows you to monitor your transactions so you can see where your company is making and spending money. It also helps when generating reports and for financial reporting. Xero has a default chart of accounts when you set up your accounting for your company. However, you also can import a chart of accounts from a previous accounting system or set up your own custom chart. Having a customized chart of accounts specific to your business is important. A customized chart of accounts ensures a consistent coding system with clear guides and detailed descriptions tailored to your company’s needs. As a result, your data will be entered correctly, even if different people are responsible for adding transactions. The customized descriptions also help ensure that transactions are coded correctly to each category over time. Having consistent data from year to year allows you to make accurate comparisons to help you make informed decisions as your business grows. The most important consideration an eCommerce business needs to make is to determine whether each expense is variable or fixed in nature.  Variable expenses will increase or decrease as sales increase or decrease.  Examples of variable expenses in eCommerce businesses are cost of sales, merchant fees, and pay per click advertising.  Fixed expenses will remain the same regardless of the level of sales.  Examples of fixed expenses would be rent and office supplies.  When you set up your Chart of Accounts, Xero requires you to allocate each expense to an account type.  Please ensure that you allocate variable expenses to ‘direct costs’ and fixed expenses to ‘expense’.Once you have made these allocations, you may wish to design a custom Profit and Loss in Xero to show the gross margin of the business.  The gross margin is the residual profit, after subtracting variable expenses from revenue, and is shown as a percentage of revenue.  Gross Margin is one of the most important indicators of a healthy eCommerce business, and drives strategic focus and what if analysis.Set up a monthly bookkeeping systemEcommerce Bookkeeping is essential for having an accurate picture of your company’s finances, so you can make informed business decisions and plan for the future. Accounting software, like Xero, makes the process of bookkeeping easier through automation. The software helps you record transactions, send invoices, make payments, prepare financial statements, and more. By establishing a monthly bookkeeping system for keeping your chart of accounts up to date, you’ll be able to assess and learn from the data that was entered.Setting up a monthly bookkeeping system helps you stay compliant with taxes and be better informed about your business by:Maintaining accurate and up to date records that reflect real-time business operations Ensuring your business is compliant with all local, state, and federal lawsHandling accounts payablePreparing invoicesGenerating inventory reportsAnalyzing revenues and expenses Reconcile transactions in Xero When you connect your bank account to Xero, bank transactions automatically import to Xero each day.  These transactions are called unreconciled transactions.  It is the responsibility of the bookkeeper to allocate (or code) each of these transactions in Xero by assigning the correct account code, or matching the transaction to an unpaid accounts receivable or payable invoices.  Once this allocation is performed the transaction is considered reconciled.The accuracy of your financial reports will depend on ensuring all unreconciled transactions are reconciled.  Therefore it is important to ensure you are reconciling your transactions as frequently as possible.Managing Foreign Currency receivable and payablesMost eCommerce businesses must deal with foreign currency.  It is very common to be importing goods from overseas, and often the payment to these suppliers is in a different currency than the source currency of the business.When paying international suppliers, the amount invoiced, amount paid and amount that lands in your suppliers is often different. This is due to the hidden international payment, FX and bank fees. Not only does this result in surprise expenses, but this also strains your supplier relationships. There are many international payment providers that help eliminate surprise fees and make faster payments - such as Airwallex. Airwallex allows businesses to open foreign currency accounts in as many currencies as you wish.  You can collect, hold, convert and transfer in multiple currencies with 90% better rates than major Australian banks. This could add up to 5% of cost savings by paying suppliers by eliminating unnecessary conversions.Airwallex also provides multi-currency corporate debit cards that your team can use to simplify manual reimbursements and chasing receipts.Airwallex also integrates with Xero to make reconciliation a breeze. Your global bank transfers and corporate card expenses will sync automatically into Xero in the right currency. A business account, built for global eCommerceGet AirwallexInventoryIf your business is holding inventory, it is advisable to consider implementing an inventory solution that can integrate with both your shopping cart and with Xero.  Many small eCommerce businesses expense inventory as it is purchased instead of allocating to the balance sheet, and moving over the correct proportion of inventory when goods are sold.  This creates lumpy profit that is not matched to sales.  An inventory system will allow the business to match cost of goods sold with sales.  It will also keep track of quantities on hand and assist with month end stock valuations and allocation of costs of landing goods to inventory.There are many inventory systems to consider, and it really depends on the requirements of the business to select the best fit for your business.  Other considerations eCommerce businesses have many additional complications to manage when preparing financial reports for the business.  In addition to managing foreign currency and inventory, businesses in this industry must manage accounting concepts such as deposits paid to suppliers, and unearned income (when a customer pays for the goods prior to delivery).  To ensure your business has accurate financial reports, it is advisable to work with a bookkeeper or accountant that specializes in this industry niche.Tracey Newman is the founder of CloudCounting, which merged with Bean Ninjas Australia in early 2021.

In the last 6 months, Australian restaurants, bars and cafes have learnt a lot about how customers have changed the way they interact with service venues and staff. Many have embraced hospitality technology and Mr Yum has led the way with a QR code mobile ordering platform transforming the experience for both customers and owners. MR YUM CO-FOUNDERS (LEFT TO RIGHT) ANDREI MIULESCU, KIM TEO, KERRY OSBORN AND ADRIAN OSMAN.

SOURCE: SUPPLIED.Unlike other providers, one of Mr Yum's key differentiators is that they are completely web based and invest heavily in product innovation and customer service. Features like tabs for groups and grouped order printing, along with 24/7 customer support has seen the company grow 27-fold in the past 12 months. Mr Yum also offers pick-up and delivery options to venues as alternatives to UberEats and Deliveroo which have higher commission fees.“Mr Yum is a product-led company, which is the key to the long-term success of our venue partners and our own. We are nimble and adaptable and listen to what venues really need in a product - and then deliver it.” 

 Mr Yum CEO Kim TeoThe hospitality industry is competitive with tight margins so many operators rejoice to see that Mr Yum doesn’t just help reduce inefficiencies. The digital visual menus make it easy for customers to order what they want and many businesses have seen average order size increase between 20-40% when using Mr Yum.Partnering for growthThe challenges faced by hospitality businesses are not unique to Australia, and investors have not missed this. AirTree Ventures and TEN13 are venture capital firms that invested in Mr Yum’s most recent post-seed funding hoping to help share best practices in Australia with the world as it re-opens.Securing over $11 million in capital in this latest round, sights are now firmly set on US and UK expansion. Mr Yum is also adding category verticals including airports, stadiums and shopping centres to bolster their reach. Quality is still crucial – and with the latest round of funding, they have an opportunity to get the best talent to deliver the best product.MR YUM’S GROWING TEAM.

Teams are already on the ground in the US and UK, and the team is set to triple. Corey Payne, Mr Yum's financial controller, is one of the freshest team members in Australia who has been brought on to prepare Mr Yum's financial systems for exponential scale in the US and UK. The successful introduction and adoption of Mr Yum’s platform in London and Los Angeles has proven just how big the potential market is.Navigating the local nuances of global businessSignificant international growth does not come without its challenges. Aside from the major cultural differences within the US, UK and Australian hospitality sectors, an organisation set up in each of these jurisdictions can vary considerably. ""Seems like a really strange conundrum that in a world where everything is so global there are so many boundaries to setting up a business and operating in a country outside where it is based.""Mr Yum Financial Controller, Corey PayneChallenges range from setting up UK bank accounts without an EU or UK-based director to not having a US citizen as company president to employ US staff.Corey's advice to other businesses wanting to expand internationally is to be aware of local differences and obtain as much on-the-ground intel as possible.""When talking about how you establish yourself outside of your home country, reach out and try to figure out - is there already a solution? Has a solution been made somewhere?"" He admits that the challenges in setting up the business in new markets are short-term hurdles. However, building local networks is vital to finding solutions to your problems.Currently, Airwallex is working with Mr Yum to set up physical and virtual cards along with UK banking. Mr Yum can instantaneously set up cards for employees and centrally manage limits or controls remotely from their Melbourne headquarters. ""It is crazy to see that kind of technology… it's just one of those ideas where you think, why has this not been done before?""Mr Yum Financial Controller, Corey PayneCentrally managed limits and controls help their newly formed business development team in the UK focus on developing partnerships within the hospitality industry rather than worrying about whether they will get reimbursed.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/3-social-enterprises-to-watch,"3 social enterprises to watch: Who Gives A Crap, Thankyou, and Single Use Ain’t Sexy","Blog3 social enterprises to watch: Who Gives A Crap, Thankyou, and Single Use Ain’t Sexy31 May 2021•4 minsCustomer storiesE-commerceStart-upsIn this article•Single Use Ain't Sexy•Who Gives A Crap  •Thankyou •Reinvesting for growth and impact with AirwallexSocial enterprise is on the rise in Australia. According to social traders.com, there are an estimated 20,000 social enterprises in the country, generating about 3% of GDP and employing around 300,000 employees. However, despite the impressive GDP figures, social enterprises measure their success in their impact and not in the profits generated. By definition, social enterprises are businesses that prioritize impact over profit-making. They deliberately trade to find solutions to prevailing social problems, improve communities, protect the environment and provide access to employment and training for people. While social enterprises in Australia originated from the non-profit sector and the cooperative and mutual business scene, not all social enterprises are non-profit. Most of them are profitable entities. Social enterprises are viable, profitable businesses that trade for a profit like every other business with one caveat; the profit motive seldom outweighs the purpose and impact of the brand. We brought together three exemplary social enterprises in Australia to hear how they are balancing impact against growth and profits.Single Use Ain't SexySingle Use Aint Sexy is a one-year-old Australian brand trying to reduce human plastic waste with a reusable plastic bottle and soap tablet. Josh Howard, CEO and founder, believed that something could be done to reduce the number of single-use plastic bottles that end up in landfills every day. Single-Use Aint Sexy developed a reusable non-plastic soap bottle that can be easily refilled with tap water and their soap tablet. So rather than buying a new soap bottle every time, one simply has to buy a soap tablet, fill the reusable bottle with water and drop in the tablet. Then you have hand soap without having to consume single-use plastic. While they just celebrated their first birthday, they have already saved more than 125,000 plastic bottles from landfills. This shows how popular the product is, which indicates the level of need for the product in the community.Josh believes that a purpose-built brand cannot struggle to grow if it solves a real need in the community. If you are genuinely solving a problem in society, scaling the business and increasing your revenues will come organically. Solve a genuine problem, and you will always have demand. “If you build a purpose-built business, then you don’t have to worry about marrying the business and product. They are one and the same. Scaling up the business will also scale the impact,” said Josh.Who Gives A Crap  Who Gives A Crap is a unique brand established to increase access to toilets for the most impoverished areas of the world by selling toilet paper. The founders said that they started the company when they realized that 40% of the world doesn't have access to toilets. This means that about 300,000 children die every year from diseases related to not having proper toilet access and sanitation. This is why Who Gives A Crap decided to make toilet paper out of recycled paper and bamboo and donate the profits to organizations installing toilets in places that don’t have enough. By using sustainable materials and donating the profits, Who Gives A Crap is creating twice the impact. This is part of the brand’s ethos. They use their purpose as a compass, guiding all other aspects of the business, even their profit motives. This was highlighted by the brand’s VP of Culture and People, Ellie Smith.     ""It is part of being purpose-driven. You have to be able to make tough calls and say no to easy wins. You have to dig deep to do the work that you really believe in, and it does pay off in the end.”Thankyou Thankyou is a 12-year-old brand that brings consumers a product choice that exists all for the end of extreme poverty. It is estimated that over 700 million people live in extreme poverty, and the supplementary funding required to end extreme poverty by 2030 is about $2.5 trillion. However, the global consumer market is about $63 trillion every year. Thankyou exists to bridge the gap between these figures, by redistributing wealth from consumer spending to fund impactful change-makers, working towards a world where not one person lives in extreme poverty.Their first product, bottled water, was produced with the intention to provide a better choice in the market that would help bring water to those in need. Thankyou by their own admission, believed bottled water was a 'silly product' that shouldn't exist. But while it did, they thought they would be able to find a solution that's a win-win for humanity and the planet in the industry.
“Our reason for starting in bottled water was that it's a silly idea that people are buying into. So we decided on a Robin Hood model - take from the bottled water industry and give to the poor because there will always be a bottled water industry,” said Pete Yao, Chief Impact Officer at Thankyou.
Despite its success, the company stopped selling the product in 2020. The decision to end a revenue stream that was giving the company millions of dollars in sales was made because selling single use plastic bottles was against their values as the plastic bottles were damaging the environment. Thankyou is willing to challenge even their own systems and structures to get to where they are headed. These are the tough decisions that purpose-driven businesses have to be willing to make.

The tagline “Makes anything taste like bacon” encapsulates founder Kjetil (KJ) Hansen’s original dream.
Deliciou was born global. The flagship bacon seasoning was birthed from KJ’s kitchen in Melbourne and sold back to friends and family in Europe. “We were able to create the global customer base from very early on, which really made a huge difference in our brand awareness and customer reach.”“We were able to create the global customer base from very early on, which really made a huge difference in our brand awareness and customer reach.”KJ, Founder at Deliciou
Deliciou now has over 80 percent of its sales from Europe and North America, offering a range of plant-based products via its e-commerce platform. It is “on a mission to make plant-based cooking easy and delicious for everyone”. Internationally-focused backers, such as US-based venture capital firm, Stray Dog Capital, and Blackmore’s Peter Osborne, signals Deliciou’s further expansion into the United States of America, Europe and Asia. 
Peter Park, Business Improvement Manager, has been at the forefront of Deliciou’s global growth. In particular, he has been instrumental in ensuring the finance infrastructure is in place for overseas expansion. With a background in venture capital and financial consulting, Peter stepped into his role at Deliciou just over a year ago to scale the business.
Many businesses within the FMCG sector start with a bricks-and-mortar presence. However, Deliciou has been online from day one. By going global, they could respond to the growing interest in vegan products. “I think our brand and the sorts of products that we offer, blend well with the trend that’s going on in the world... the food trend is also about engaging in something more meaningful ethically and environmentally.”

Bypassing bottlenecks: instant transactions with Airwallex
“If you’re a global business, there are global customers – and those global customers don’t pay in Australian dollars.”Peter Park, Business Improvement Officer at Deliciou
For Deliciou, a great customer experience means that customers are not charged unnecessary foreign transaction fees. The purchase experience must be seamless. For many international organisations, this means engaging different payment platforms, and the trade-off is that this locks up cash for the business. 
As a problem-solver, Peter needed to find a way to bypass embedded bottlenecks within the global banking system.12 months saved by avoiding setting up a local bank accountView case study
Airwallex’s virtual accounts in the United Kingdom, European Union and United States of America have enabled Deliciou to collect revenue in local currencies and send it back to Australia at a fraction of the cost, saving them almost four per cent on the margin. Deliciou’s payment processing time has gone from three to four days down to one to two days using Airwallex.
“If you want to go global, get [on with] Airwallex now…the word global and Airwallex should always go together.”Peter Park, Business Improvement Officer at DeliciouPeter’s advice to businesses thinking about international expansion is simple. Think cashflow. By mapping out the cash journey, businesses are able to identify potential roadblocks, like setting up foreign bank accounts – which can take months, freeing up cash from payment gateways. For Peter, “Airwallex was the tool that enabled a very efficient cash journey… not many tools can do that.”

Big ambitions: What’s next for Deliciou?
Deliciou has big ambitions. Pursuing a 300-400 per cent growth off the back of success in Europe and North America, Deliciou is looking to expand to more countries with wholesale being a significant go to market channel. With continued global expansion of the business, Peter is insistent that Airwallex will be part of the journey.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/growth-through-covid-rapid-expansion-with-bubble-tea-club,Growth Through COVID: Rapid Expansion with Bubble Tea Club,"BlogGrowth Through COVID: Rapid Expansion with Bubble Tea Club19 April 2021•4 minsCustomer storiesE-commerceBubble Tea Club is a DIY bubble tea kit brand, as co-founder Jenny Le says, “we found it insane that it was such a big industry but there were no DIY Kits.”Based in Melbourne, Jenny and co-founder Pam Yip started the brand as a way to bring bubble (or “boba”) tea away from the stores and into the home. The online store quickly gained popularity, with Jenny and Pam working around the clock to keep up with the sudden demand for their product.Since its inception in April 2020, Bubble Tea Club has distributed one million servings of DIY bubble tea, and was nominated for a National Retail Award People’s Choice Award. Its products include classic bubble tea flavours like taro milk tea and mango fruit tea through to special collaborations with Masterchef Jess Lemon and others to launch their own bubble tea kits.Bubble Tea Club experienced massive growth in a short periodCOVID-19 and its ensuing lockdowns created a desire to have bubble tea at home. For Bubble Tea Club, this meant experiencing exponential growth within a few months in 2020. The rapid growth soon caused headaches for Bubble Tea Club, with the company struggling to store products in its original space. Furthermore, working remotely as a new team whilst keeping up with increasing demand was proving difficult.“That was part of growing - recognising that we can’t do things on our own. You’re managing marketing to a handful of people and then suddenly you’re managing it to tens of thousands of people.”Pamela Yip, Co-Founder at Bubble Tea ClubBubble Tea Club had to scale up, and so Jenny and Pam decided to take the business to a 500sqm space with the capacity to fit 30 staff, whom they enlisted to meet the demand for their product. The larger space allows them to store premium ingredients imported from the home of bubble tea, Taiwan.Trusting yourself whilst listening to feedback are vital for expansionJenny and Pam continue to improve their brand based on customer feedback. Pam stresses the importance of taking on customer feedback whilst trusting your gut and knowing which issues are truly important for the brand. “You have to trust yourself: it goes with the team, it goes with the inventory and it goes with having a network of people around you. You’re the one who is facing your business every single day, so you trust yourself as to what is the next step and what is the right decision to make.” Pamela Yip, Co-Founder at Bubble Tea ClubAirwallex helped Bubble Tea Club pay international supplies in local currenciesImporting ingredients from international suppliers can be expensive. Jenny and Pam needed a way they could import bubble tea ingredients from Taiwan without the hefty foreign exchange fees.Airwallex enables Jenny and Pam to import premium Taiwanese ingredients without hefty FX fees using it’s Foreign Currency Accounts product, something that has helped the company save on importing costs. The brand continues to win boba fans across Australia, and its popularity is so great that Jenny and Pam are now working towards trialling their product in the United States and New Zealand.  The co-founders believe Airwallex will play a large role in this expansion by enabling US and NZ customers to pay in local currencies. Airwallex also allows companies to save on paying ecommerce and social media platforms, something that is important for Bubble Tea Club’s growth.“If we’re setting a lot of international products and systems then we are copping a lot of fees. With Airwallex, we are able to save a lot on things like Facebook, and this allows us to redistribute the money to the right places.” Pamela Yip, Co-Founder at Bubble Tea ClubWhat’s next for Bubble Tea Club?As well as its planned expansion into the US and New Zealand, Bubble Tea Club has received interest from Canada and the United Kingdom. Jenny and Pam are now working towards moving their supply chain to the US and inviting anyone internationally to join the Bubble Tea Club and experience the fun of making bubble tea at home. “People say to us that once they try our bubble tea they don’t go back to stores. We can’t wait for bubble tea lovers outside of Australia to be able to say the same.”Pamela Yip, Co-Founder at Bubble Tea Club

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/employee-airtime-with-sean-li-product-lead-based-in-shanghai,"Employee Airtime with Sean Li, Product Lead based in Shanghai","BlogEmployee Airtime with Sean Li, Product Lead based in Shanghai15 April 2021•5 minutesWelcome to Employee Airtime! In this content series, we sit down with our talented team to talk about why they're excited to work at Airwallex, their passions and what gets them out of bed in the morning! Introducing Sean Li, Product Lead based in Shanghai. How did you start your role at Airwallex? Firstly, a little bit about myself. I was born in China and after college, mostly worked in enterprise software and fintech companies in the US. I later co-founded a company in San Francisco called Prelim - which built white-labeled software for banks and credit unions - and raised US$2 million through participating in Y Combinator.  I moved back to China in 2019. After taking a break and some unfinished entrepreneurial explorations, I started looking for opportunities for rapid personal growth. I was interviewing at a couple of leading tech companies in China when I stumbled upon Airwallex – and after asking around, I found out that some of my college friends worked at the startup (both of them were top students and had worked at stellar companies previously, a very positive indicator!). I applied for a product role, which resulted in (successful) interviews with Jack (CEO), Xijing (CTO) and Craig (VP, Global Head of Platform). What were your first impressions of Airwallex? On my first day in the office, I noticed an uncanny resemblance to my previous workplaces in Silicon Valley. Examples include similar office decor, welcome gifts, meeting rooms, casual attire, pantry and ergonomic furniture. We also use a range of the most popular productivity software such as Slack, JIRA, Trello, Confluence, Gmail, Zoom, Figma, HubSpot and WeChat.
Of course, this was all secondary to the people I had begun to meet – young, bright minds who are always in active discourse whenever you walked around an office corner.The only obvious difference is that most of my (then new) colleagues in the Shanghai office spoke to each other in Chinese. That’s not a problem for anyone who didn’t speak Chinese however, as the company’s official working language is English, particularly as we work very closely with global teams. How have you found the culture at Airwallex?  To me, I see culture as the manifestation of people’s values and beliefs in the organisation. There are three values at Airwallex that I subscribe to and feel very strongly about:Craftsmanship - Perfection matters. When building products, we focus on the details to make sure the experience is truly 'seamless” (an overused word, but I really mean it). If we didn’t build like a craftsman, it’s going to show. Obsessive Curiosity - Never stop at the answer. Keep asking for the ‘why’ until you’re truly satisfied. Whenever we are trying to solve a problem, we challenge why something should work the way it does in the first place. What are all the implications when we do something differently? Why do they matter? The best founders all have a spike in this quality which is why they make an impact on the world. I’d like to do the same. Intellectual Honesty - Seek the truth and be ready to admit when you are wrong. At Airwallex, we are creating an environment where it doesn't matter if you were incorrect when facing a challenge. What matters is acknowledging the problem and finding a new path forward.  From a day-to-day perspective, we balance working culture values with necessary output. As a result, you decide what hours are needed to achieve the desired outcome and how you’d like to structure your day. Second, we are constantly helping the team to get to know everyone, learn from each other, and build shared perspectives. For example, we hold a session in the Shanghai office called MeetX, where team members share experiences via a presentation or a fireside chat. We also run various knowledge sharing sessions across our global teams.Patrick from the Data Team sharing lessons from boxing at a MeetX sessionSean doing a fireside chat with Kai at another MeetX sessionA technical sharing series on the basics of ML systemsThird, we do work hard and play hard. There are regular team building and social activities to foster strong relationships with colleagues. What’s it like working with the Airwallex leadership team?  I think we’ve got an amazing mix of experience and talent on the management team at Airwallex, striking a balance between accomplished hires and internal promotions. The team is diverse and globally distributed, with women making up for more than a third of our senior management team. Equal gender representation is something we are constantly working towards, particularly with a woman co-founder (Lucy).From a team member’s perspective, there is direct access to anyone in the company. I personally work closely with senior management on a daily basis. One of the Product Managers on my team actually communicates frequently with the CEO, CTO and Head of Product Design who are also co-founders of Airwallex (more exposure, but also more pressure :P but that’s how you grow!). Are there ample opportunities for personal and career growth? There is a lot of room for personal and career growth at Airwallex. For example, I initially started on our Global Treasury and Payment Network Platform product. I now cover more of the SME product proposition. This has forced me to continue growing outside my comfort zone.
Successful candidates will learn to set up processes, create best practices (and learn from mistakes), lead a team, help others be successful, build out the culture and be the change you want to see.Sean organising and running the first team all-hands with Winson and Jun Promotions can happen anytime so long as the person has proven themselves and delivered impact. Age and experience are non-factors. Along the way, high performers are trusted with more responsibilities. What are some key challenges you’ve faced? Working at Airwallex is like building a rocket-ship while in flight. This creates enormous challenges, including:  People and hiring - Finding the right people can be a challenge. We want to ensure we have a mix of new talent being introduced, as well as talent being grown in the businesses. Having great people also helps us continue to decentralise decision making, allowing leadership to focus on context, not control.Priorities and focus - At the company level, we have limited resources. At the personal level, each one of us has limited time. One of the most challenging things about scaling is: how do we prioritise through the noise and push for the things that matter? This requires constant learning and experimentation with goal setting frameworks, at both a company-wide and individual-team level.Coaching and mentoring - To build a highly performing and sustainable team, there needs to be constant coaching and mentoring. This has been a key focus for the business, having recently implemented LinkedIn Learning company-wide. Communication and documentation - We are on track to significantly increase our staff count by the end of the year. Rapid growth can strain internal processes, so we are always looking for better ways to make our communications more efficient.Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs

Yes, finding an online selling platform that caters to the niche you’re in is good, but it isn’t the end.You want to make sure that even if you’re in a niche like women’s fashion, you can still sell all your items like dresses, hats, jewellery, shoes, bags, scarfs and other accessories. Once a customer perceives your brand as reliable after a good shopping experience, they won’t want to go through the hassle of having to get different products of yours from different platforms instead of one collective order.Affordable feesOnline marketplaces charge varying fees for selling on their platforms and you need to do more than just picking one with affordable fees. It helps to register with a platform that offers tiered plans with different pricing depending on the services or features you’d like to have in your package.This kind of structure allows you to start small at a lower cost and gradually upgrade to the higher premium plans as your sales grow to a point where you need some of the features that simplify bulk selling.Large and active audience baseIt goes without saying that a website that gets more visitors and garners more conversions all the way through to the checkout is more ideal for your business. However, there’s a little more nuance to how you should apply this ideology.eCommerce store owners ought to try and find out which products on those marketplaces sell most, or get more views. A marketplace may accommodate your carpets and other furniture products, but you may find that amongst all their household product listings, people visit mainly to buy kitchenware.This may not bode well for your business. Some of this marketplace sales data may not be easy to come by but you can always rely on consumer reports, social proof like reviews, ratings and testimonials both on- and off-site, along with some other basic analytics tools to learn more about these websites’ traffic.International selling featuresIf you plan on growing your store to sell to customers in various countries, you should be on the lookout for marketplaces that offer international selling features. These range from shipping and courier options to payment methods and region-specific price and tax information among others.Such features not only make it easy for shoppers to have a good estimate of what it will cost to buy from your store, but also provide greater flexibility in how they pay for, receive and return goods. You’re also more likely to discover and expose your products to small segments of the market where larger competitors may not have a foothold yet.Discovery and promotion featuresThe most popular online marketplaces are quite crowded and there’s stiff competition over whose products get more views and sales. It is very advantageous to select a marketplace that not only has its own native programs that boost visibility for winning products but also gives you the ability to pay for better placement and partner with the platform in discount efforts.A good online marketplace should also have a robust system for gathering social proof and incorporating user-generated data into its product placement framework.Top global online marketplacesAmazonAmazon is one of the top global eCommerce marketplaces where sellers stand a good chance of increasing sales with minimal marketing costs. With over 40% of its total unit sales coming from third-parties, it is one of the best eCommerce websites supporting over 30 product categories.Some vital global features of this platform include the ability to choose between your own fulfilment, or fulfilment by Amazon where you don’t have to worry about packing, shipping and returns, thanks to its 185 fulfilment centres. Therefore, it is no surprise that Amazon has at least 310 million active customer accounts being served by over 2.5 million sellers as of 2019.The platform also facilitates international selling, with a formidable back-end to track inventory, manage sales tax collection, etc. Learn about how to sell on Amazon US from Australia in this complete guide.eBayIf affordability is a priority for you, eBay’s lower fees which stand at 10% per sale, and roughly 13% if you add payment processing) will help you feel at home. This platform also facilitates auctioning of products, with the ability to set a reserve price.This American multinational eCommerce marketplace also has at least 185 million active users as of Q4 of 2020 coupled with well-tuned SEO, which increases the likelihood of your products appearing in searches, being viewed and purchased.EtsyConceived in the U.S., Etsy offers a user-friendly interface and smooth experience when adding new shops and product listings.

Your business can sell to all the available countries and you only compete with other vendors, not the AliExpress itself.Furthermore, AliExpress has a secure and speedy payment system where you can receive your cut the minute a customer confirms that the product has arrived.RakutenRakuten runs the largest eCommerce website in Japan, serving millions of customers. Traders can sell products in over 10 categories internationally, as the platform has helped over 49,800 sellers deliver to 79 countries. The platform also supports the personalisation of storefronts to reflect your business’ brand image.One of its main standout features is R-mail, an email marketing tool that enables effective retargeting of previous buyers, and access to a dedicated eCommerce consultant.FruugoWhen it comes to taking eCommerce stores international, Fruugo is one online marketplace Australia can massively benefit from.

Lazada stands out with its Lazada University, where successful sellers can educate new ones on how to set up their operations on the platform and increase sales.This effort is also complemented by the easy-to-use back-end administration and weekly reports on store performance delivered via email. Lazada’s base location makes it one of the online selling sites Australia can embrace to sell more to neighbours.Fashion and Apparel is the largest cross-border eCommerce product category, so let’s also look at the leading online fashion marketplaces:ASOSASOS is an English marketplace that enables eCommerce store owners to sell in the United States, Spain, Germany, France, Italy and Australia. The platform primarily supports independent labels and vintage selections for both men and women.ASOS doesn’t charge commission for product listings, has no minimum stay period and offers a holiday mode for temporarily closing listings without a full-on account cancellation. There’s also no upper limit on products per catalogue.ZalandoZalando is a German-based eCommerce platform that is great for store owners seeking expansion in Europe since it is present in at least 17 European countries. These include the U.K., Norway, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Spain, Belgium and Finland.The platform gets over 7 billion site visits a year from more than 48  million active customers,  and offers over 1.4 million fashion products across 5,800 brands. Zalando also has helpful customer agents when it comes to registering as a seller, and experts who can advise you on profit maximisation strategies.PoshmarkPoshmark is an American online marketplace that focuses on used and resold clothing. The platform doesn’t charge listing fees, provides easy shipping and has a large and active customer base. Poshmark does a good job at reinvesting the commission fees into advertising to attract more buyers. The platform also benefits business owners selling different types of attire (jeans, dresses, etc.) from varying brands.Now that we’ve listed some of the top online marketplaces, let’s lay out some strategies that can help you achieve international success while selling on these platforms.5 online marketplace strategies to sell internationallyHarness social proof – Many shoppers are more likely to buy from brands that other people have given a thumbs up. Getting buyers to give you good reviews can be tough, which is why you should have some small incentives set aside in the form of free goods, coupons and vouchers, discounts, temporary free access to some premium account features, etc.Watch the competition – Whether it’s simple site visits as a customer or going deeper with analytics tools, keep an eye on your competitors’ moves, especially things like free shipping and surprise giveaways. These will help you adjust your prices accordingly. You can also go as far as automating the repricing process. Do not neglect minor moves like theme changes and new product sections.Deter counterfeiters – People will go to great lengths to get customers' attention, going as far as spamming shoppers with fake offers in your name. Remind your customers about the unique identifiers of your brand messages and always stay ahead when it comes to informing them about new offers. You can also subscribe to some service providers who specialise in thwarting counterfeit programs.Leverage promotions – You most probably won’t hit your sales targets through pure organic traffic. Engage in promotional activities (like eBay deals) that are supported by the platform you’re selling on. Put out some paid advertising where possible to reach potential customers outside your established supporters.Optimise product content – Share the information that research has shown to be influential in buying decisions. This could be anything from displaying high-quality product images from multiple angles to listing a summary of product benefits, and even showing the stock/availability levels. Ensure that titles, image metadata and other product information is in-line with the relevant keywords in order to improve visibility through searches.A global business account to connect to your global marketplacesAs you begin to sell internationally on your marketplace of choice, a necessary step is to have a compatible global business account that allows you to connect and collect your foreign currency revenues. Airwallex’s foreign currency account connects seamlessly with leading global marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Lazada.With a single global business account, you can collect your payment faster, with no surprise, foreign currency fees eat into your margin.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/differences-in-cnh-vs-cny,CNH vs CNY: the Differences in Chinese Renminbi,"BlogCNH vs CNY: the Differences in Chinese Renminbi17 March 2021•5 minutesFinanceIn this article•China’s challenging currency •A quick look at the Chinese RMB•What are the differences between CNY and CNH?•Why are they different?•So, is RMB the same as CNY?•What does this mean for businesses who want to send money to China?•An Airwallex Global Business Account is a better banking alternative China has taken its place as a leading producer and exporter of goods on an international level. Focusing on the well-being of its economy, the growth China has seen over the last century is remarkable. By placing the focus on energising its economy, China has become a contender in extraordinary advancements within the global economy and trade market. 
As the world’s second-largest economy, China is also home to several of the most powerful technology companies, with global reach and innovative technologies that will have exceptional impacts on our planet’s future overall. The Chinese people’s hard work has come to fruition. Their support, talent and ingenuity are a major contributor to the growth of their energised economy. 
It’s essential to understand China’s CNH currency and how CNH and CNY differ. 
In 2016, the renminbi (RMB) and CNH currencies were included on the list of most-used currencies, joining the US dollar, euro, yen and British pound. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared the equality of the RMB and the US dollar, but this is no longer valid in 2022 after the COVID-19 pandemic and recent economic decline. 
Today, the RMB is ranked below the US dollar according to the Special Drawing Right (SDR). Created by the IMF, the SDR is an international reserve established to support other countries’ reserves. Based on a blend of currencies from all over the world, the SDR includes the US dollar, Japanese yen, euro, pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi. 
When Chinese export costs increase, the country’s trade market suffers and ultimately loses its competitive prices, which appeals to the rest of the world. And the Chinese economy thrives on its ability to keep costs lower than other countries’ products, trade rates and employment rates. However, the Central Bank of the Republic of China monitors exchange rates and will adjust costs accordingly to avoid any negative effects of the CNH and the RMB. China’s challenging currency The RMB has seen its share of challenges over the years, predominantly due to the Chinese government’s constraints on the currency. Historically known as a leading force in the world’s retail industry, China offers extraordinary opportunities for businesses to thrive in the international market. 
Interestingly, China’s two types of currencies can cause challenging circumstances when trading with China. After breaking into the market, you’ll become aware of China’s unusual currencies, CNH vs CNY and the exchange rates.
Yes, that’s plural. China has two currencies. Knowing the differences between them can be a valuable asset when transferring funds internationally. 
If your business requires trade with China, learn the specifics of the country’s currencies by understanding the RMB, yuan and CNH vs CNY.A quick look at the Chinese RMBRMBSo, what’s the RMB? 
“Renminbi” is the official name of the currency of the People’s Republic of China, much like the Australian dollar, US dollar or pound sterling. “Renminbi” translates to “people’s money” in Mandarin. The abbreviation for renminbi is RMB, and RMB is typically the preferred term when talking about Chinese currencies in financial circles.YuanWhile renminbi is the currency’s official name, the yuan is the unit of currency. Think of it like this: in England, the currency is officially called pound sterling, but the unit of currency is called a pound. 
The symbol for yuan is ¥ (the same as the Japanese yen).
Makes sense so far, doesn’t it? But then comes another difference. There are two types of yuan: CNY and CNH.CNH vs CNYThere are two types of RMB, each covering a different major trading market:CNY is RMB that’s traded in mainland China. CNH is RMB that’s traded offshore from mainland China, such as in Hong Kong.The difference between CNY vs CNH depends on the location of the transaction. 
What are the differences between CNY and CNH?While both the CNY and CNH are types of currencies for the same country, and both worth the same amount of Renminbi—they’re not technically the same currency. Both of these currencies have different exchange rates and are traded at different amounts.
And, as they have different exchange rates, they’re worth different amounts—but not against each other.
In China, you’re simply dealing with Chinese Renminbi. It’s all the same Renminbi, whether it’s CNY or CNH. Exchanging the two works at a 1:1 exchange rate.
It’s only when the RMB is subject to external factors do the differences in exchange rate become apparent.Why are they different?CNY is government-controlled, designed to enable greater charge over its domestic currency and empowering trade between Chinese companies.
Foreign businesses who trade within mainland China can still accept CNY as payment, but if they want to use Renminbi offshore, they’ll need to exchange CNY to CNH.
CNH, on the other hand, is designed as an offshore version of Renminbi. This way Renminbi can be freely traded, and is essentially controlled by the will of the free market which determines its value, while still ensuring China’s internal Renminbi remains strong.So, is RMB the same as CNY?RMB and CNY are essentially the same thing.
Think of it this way. It’s like you were to go out to a cafe in Australia: you’d buy a coffee, it might cost you $4.50. You’d hand over $5, and get 50c in change. You’re giving and receiving dollars and cents —but it’s all still the Australian Dollar.
The relationship between RMB and yuan is the same. In these terms there’s essentially no difference: Chinese Renminbi is the official currency, yuan is the name of a unit of Chinese Renminbi currency. What does this mean for businesses who want to send money to China?If you’re looking to send money to China, it’s important to be aware of which currency you’re operating in. You’re dealing with RMB, you know that. And you can certainly send money in CNY. But if you receive money from a Chinese business, it’s likely to be in CNH. So it’s important to note that there may be an exchange difference in your dealings there.
You should also be aware of restrictions and requirements on international money transfers, in order to ensure a smooth flow of funds. For example, the order information is required by the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange on CNY inbound transactions, to prove the source of the funds. Banks will need order information to record the funds to accounts. An Airwallex Global Business Account is a better banking alternative Airwallex is making digital business finance easy with our Global Business Account.You get all the benefits of a digital business account, but with added benefits and features that are built for a global scale.You can set up a Foreign Currency Account in seconds, and start transacting straight away.

Who uses foreign currency accounts?•What are global business accounts, and how are they different?•The advantages of a global business account•Collect international payments more securely with AirwallexThese days, all of the big banks offer some form of an international business account option. But not all are created equal.Some banks offer foreign currency accounts, dedicated to specific currencies. Others might offer a global business account, made specifically for larger organisations. It can be confusing as a business to find the type of account that’s right for your needs.So let’s look at the difference between foreign currency accounts and global business accounts, and what this means for your business.What are foreign currency accounts?A foreign currency account is a specific account offered by your bank that allows you to send, receive, and hold foreign currencies. They’re also known as multi-currency accounts, due to their capacity to hold multiple foreign currencies within the account. It’s essentially like having different wallets available for different currencies. Thanks to this feature, a foreign currency account actually allows you to sidestep some of the disadvantages associated with international money transfers. Instead of sending and receiving currency immediately, at the mercy of international exchange rates, you’re able to hold this foreign currency safely within your dedicated account. This works to effectively hedge against currency fluctuations. You can then convert your currency at a time that suits you, enabling you to choose a time and a rate that suits you better.This leads us to one of the big benefits of a foreign currency account. Unlike a traditional international money transfer, you don’t have to convert your money every time to send or receive a payment. As your account is dedicated to foreign currencies, you’re sending and receiving money already in that currency. There are no associated transfer fees.However, you’re still transferring money between banks internationally using SWIFT bank details, so there are still transfer fees involved. It’s important to check the fee structure that your bank has imposed on your foreign currency account. Figures vary between banks, and you may find yourself paying up to $20 each time to send and receive your funds. Also, if you want to access your foreign currency funds through a debit or credit card to pay for things like USD software subscriptions, traditional foreign currency accounts do not come with an attached business card. This means you need to transfer and convert your foreign currency funds into your local AUD business account with a payment card attached to use your funds - often incurring two international transaction fees. First, when you’re converting into AUD, and another 3% international card transaction fee when you make the payment.
Who uses foreign currency accounts?Businesses of all sizes can benefit from using a foreign currency account.eCommerce businesses with a predominantly international client base will find them particularly useful. You’re able to send and receive payment in your target market’s currency, without needing to pay currency conversion fees each time. Professional services with international clients or agencies that work with remote staff and freelancers will find foreign currency accounts particularly useful. They allow you to pay wages and contractor fees in their local currency, without relying on intermediary platforms and or online job boards (which are known to take a percentage each way).Foreign currency accounts are also useful for retail or manufacturing companies with global customers, and wholesalers who want to receive payment from their wholesalers, then pay their suppliers directly with this currency, rather than converting currency every time.What are global business accounts, and how are they different?Global business accounts work in a similar fashion to foreign currency accounts. But we like to think of them as the upgrade to foreign currency accounts to really lower the cost of global business.These accounts are typically run through partner networks. Your bank in Australia might be part of a network that covers the UK, Europe, Canada, and the US, for example. With a global business account, you’re then able to set up an account in a foreign country with that country’s local bank details. So while you’re opening the account here in Australia, you’re able to connect globally and use the local payment networks. You’re able to use your new local account details, in that particular country, to send and receive payments in their currency like a local, and avoid international transfer fees altogether.The advantages of a global business accountIn addition to the benefits associated with foreign currency accounts, there are some big advantages that come with a global business account.Faster payments. You’re using local banking methods to send and receive payments, which cuts out a lot of the intermediary systems involved with international transfers. This cuts down your transfer times dramatically.Less confusion. You’re using local bank details instead of international bank details and SWIFT codes, which will be much easier for your international customers, clients, and suppliers to understand.Lower fees and fewer costs. Making a local bank transfer, rather than taking the time to make an international money transfer, comes with less fees, and there are fewer intermediary costs involved.But as these are very much business accounts, they’re charged as such. Global business accounts may charge high monthly fees. Some may even require a minimum deposit amount that you need in your account before you can start transacting. Collect international payments more securely with AirwallexAt Airwallex, we’ve created a powerful alternative to foreign currency accounts. Our Global Business Accounts are made for businesses who have their eyes set firmly on international growth Unlike these other accounts, Airwallex doesn’t charge any setup fees.

The fourth & final step? 

Scaling your marketing and customer demand! In this post, we’re going to discuss precisely that -- how you can launch and market your product beyond Australia. 

Launching in a New Market Requires Brand and Performance MarketingThe biggest mistake eCommerce store owners make when expanding internationally is launching the same promotional offers in a new market. 
The problem with that approach? Chances are, your brand has zero awareness in the new market you’re targeting. That means you need to market your brand and run ads to test products, offers, and drive sales. Brand MarketingNo matter the industry, product, customer or size, a company’s brand is its single most important asset. Most people see Nike as a clothing and shoe manufacturer. I see them as a Herculean (excuse the fitting Ancient Greek reference) brand. 
The tricky thing about brand marketing is the ROI is often unquantifiable. What you’re left with is the allure of vanity metrics - clicks, views, likes, shares - that don’t give you an accurate picture of how your brand is interacting with the world. 
But despite the nebulous nature of your company’s brand - there are things that you can influence: Champions: people who advocate for your brand (influencers, customers, employees, partners, etc.)Brand assets: what your brand owns or does that allows you to uniquely provide what you promise your customers. Leveraging influencers and user-generated content is still one of the most effective ways to grow your brand in 2021. We’re not suggesting you blow your budget on expensive influencers; you need to incentivize your customers to create content and find local champions like micro-influencers that share similar values to your brand. 
Partner and collaborate with influencers for authentic content and real brand growth. The key is working with influencers that make sense for your brand. Aside from producing good content that creates influence through positive associations, you can ensure that your brand campaigns are adding value in the form of word-of-mouth referrals and revenue. Performance MarketingPerformance marketing is all about maximizing ROI. As an advertiser, you only pay when a specific action is completed; such as a sale, lead or click. Testing your products, offers, and messaging with paid ads is highly effective because you can see what works and what doesn’t - quickly. It’s almost an instant feedback loop that you can iterate on with long-term vision. We covered the most effective paid channels you can leverage in part 2 of the International eCommerce series, but here’s a refresh:Social channels: Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, PPC channels: Google, BingIdentifying and Investing in the Right Channels for Your Audience AbroadThe key to winning with paid advertising channels is selling directly where your audience lives. Instagram is one of the most effective sales channels to leverage because:It’s visual (brilliant for showcasing products).Its users are engaged millennials (80% of users follow a brand)Its users are making purchases (Instagram has the second highest AOV of all social channels, following Pinterest)It’s continually adding new features that are commerce friendly (Instagram live shopping, Facebook pay, and more).Does that mean you should use Instagram to target your new market? Short answer: no. The right channel is the channel where your audience already lives. The question is: who are your customers and where do they spend their time online? 
Here are five steps to help you answer that question:1. Identify your ideal customer: create a fictional persona of your ideal customer profile (ICP). The clearer your ICP is, the easier it is to find people on social media in your target market. 2. Use Facebook Ads Manager to estimate the size of your audience in your target market.3. Survey your existing customer base - it’s likely that your ideal customer in your target market hang out in the same places online. 4. Research online behaviour by finding studies and infographics that provide information on specific platforms or other countries. 5. Find and connect with your customers. 
Why Brand Building is Critical When Expanding InternationallyIn seeking to increase your businesses growth through international expansion, establishing and building a brand is essential. Your brand is your reputation. And reputation = trust. Remember how we mentioned that when expanding into a new market you have zero brand awareness? That also means you have zero trust. Building a reputation in a new market involves a first impression, which comes from the initial interactions someone has with your company, products, and services. You can shape or form the branding of your company with brand marketing strategies and channels, which we highlighted above. The secret to building a brand internationally is doing your homework. Aside from the things we’ve already covered, like ensuring you have a market overseas and your ability to deliver; one of the most crucial factors to consider is that your product marketing is aligned with cultural expectations and doesn’t insult anyone in different parts of the world. Here are some hilarious examples of F500 brands that experienced cultural blunders when marketing their products internationally:In Spain, when Coors Brewing Company translated its slogan “Turn it loose” into Spanish, it read as: “Suffer from diarrhea”. In Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan “finger-lickin’ good” came out as “Eat your fingers off”.These initial impressions could make or break your brand in international markets so make sure you do your homework and re-examine product names, packaging, slogans/promotions, your logo, and intellectual property. Applying a Data-driven Approach to Your International Marketing Strategy For your marketing strategy to be data-driven, you need to collect comprehensive data that allow you to make data-backed decisions. That means you need to test the language you use (copy), seasonal offers and product ranges, and pricing. With language, aside from ensuring that your copy is culturally sensitive to your target region, you also need to revise your product names. For example, if you’re selling homeware like “quilt covers”, you’d want to rename it to “doona cover” depending on the region. With seasonal products and ranges, you need to test different offers to find fitting customer demand. For example, you might offer a X% discount or $X off with $X minimum spend. Play around with different offers and discounts (we’ve outlined various in our previous post on product pricing and promotions. Analyse Your Ad Performance to Learn Which Products, Offers, and Messages Resonate With Your New MarketAnalysing your ad performance is crucial because it allows you to learn which products and offers perform best so that you can double-down on them and keep doing more of what’s working. To take that a step further, analysing ad performance across different markets is important because customer preferences differ and you’ll need to localize your international marketing strategy to improve conversions. The question is: what should you be looking at when analysing ad performance? As we covered in previous posts in this series, the two metrics that will give you a solid grasp of performance are: Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). Let’s highlight the difference for clarity's sake. While ROMI measures how much revenue a marketing campaign is generating compared to the total costs of running the campaign, ROAS measures the revenue a specific ad campaign generates compared to the costs of running said ads. Most eCommerce businesses should be looking for profitability on first purchase, with repeat purchases driving lifetime value. To determine profitability, test out multiple different offers with low-cost ads on advertising platforms like Instagram or Facebook. Remember - marketing is all about doing what’s already working. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. With that in mind, a great starting point is doing competitor research using the Facebook Ads library. While browsing your competitors' ads, ask yourself:What are your competitors offering?What are their advertising styles? Visual creative? Copy? What can you adapt to your ads while balancing your brand differentiation?Accelerate your global expansion with International eCommerce playbookWe built this free International eCommerce Playbook to unpack everything you need to know.

Now we’re creating more products to continue having a positive impact in a lot of people’s lives”. “We started with the idea of a key organiser. Now we’re creating more products to continue having a positive impact in a lot of people’s lives”Charles Ng, Co-Founder at OrbitkeyBased out of Melbourne, co-founders Charles Ng and Rex Kuo created a simple idea of a key organiser to stop the ‘key jingle’ during their runs. This simple key organiser idea quickly gained traction and the duo decided to make the leap from their careers in Pharmacy and Industrial design to build the Orbitkey business full time.Today, Orbitkey is sold in over 1,000 stores across Australia, Europe and the US - from independent gift shops, design stores and fashion stores. Their product range is continuing to expand into desk mats, organisers and notable collaborations with Qantas, Crumpler and others.OrbitKey leapt right into a global audience with Kickstarter campaignsOrbitkey started in 2013 through Kickstarter and was able to draw over 5,000 backers through their 30 day campaign. Since then, Orbitkey continues to build their global community through five additional Kickstarter campaigns with 39,000 backers, raising over US$2.65 million. This global customer base from day one allowed them to draw the attention of European wholesalers and distributors. Through European trade shows, Orbitkey accelerated their international expansion beyond Australia by tapping into the existing distributor networks in the region.Localising is the key to winning in new marketsInternational growth poses a myriad of challenges for business. Co-founder Rex described that building strong wholesaler relationships and a network of international stockists was challenging.“The most important part for business expanding internationally comes down to localisation. People don’t want to buy out of an Australian warehouse, they want to be buying from a local warehouse. They don’t want to be paying to an unfamiliar bank account with high fees, they want to be paying like a local”Rex Kuo, Co-Founder at OrbitkeyTo build their audience fast, they needed to find ways to localise their payment and shipping infrastructure for that local experience. A global audience also meant dealing with the inherent challenges of international currencies; currency fluctuations and transfer rates became issues for not only Orbitkey, but its key customers too. Rex explained that wholesalers were forced to pay Orbitkey in AUD, the transfer cost alone forcing some to pull out all together. Airwallex provided an EUR Foreign Currency Account with local European bank account details that allowed Orbitkey and their wholesalers to pay with ease.“We were paying $37 per transfer, now with Airwallex we’re paying a third of that price, in AUD”Hai Trang, Virtual CFO at OrbitkeyOrbitkey wholesalers make 70% faster payments with AirwallexRead full storyWhat’s ahead for OrbitKeyOrbitkey’s vision is to create “100 million points of organisation impact”, explains Charles. The team continues to innovate and expand their product ranges to help people “simplify and organise for a better life”. Most recently, the team has launched an Orbitkey ID Card Holder product on Kickstarter.With 25 employees, Charles and Rex also have ambitious growth plans for their team to meet the oversized demand they’re facing internationally.“We love working with Orbitkey, they are an awesome business with great products and a team with a global vision.

It was a “who you knew” business that, in a globalised world, was struggling to keep up with the demand for fast and efficient international trade. Enter DocShipper: a company founded to redefine international logistics & procurement for SMEs, corporations and individuals. The two founders Nicolas and Pierre Rahmé have the goal to shake up an industry that is stuck in the pre-digital era, and so have implemented new technologies to facilitate international business relations. Headquartered in Hong Kong, DocShipper now operates across 40 countries, providing its expertise in Africa, Asia, Australia, America and Europe. This is about how DocShipper is using innovation to modernise a tired industry, and how its partnership with Airwallex helps it to deliver outstanding service for global customers. Implementing new technology to manage customer supply chain logisticsDocShipper provides an end-to-end solution that aims to alleviate the hassles of supply chain management. Taking ownership of the process so that customers don’t have to worry about issues that arise between supplier, shipping agent and customs officer, DocShipper provides:Product sourcing from different countries, including handling regulatory requirements and quality controlTraditional freight forwarding and customs clearance3rd party logistics to help distribute products to customers via own warehouses“We take care of the project 100% of the way.” says Nicolas Rahme, Founder & CEO of DocShipper. “We deal with every aspect of the project, from the door of the supplier to the door of the customer. That’s what makes us different - we are in control of the whole project.”Putting the focus back on the customerTraditional freight forwarding and sourcing companies typically focus their efforts on larger organisations. This often leaves SMEs and individual traders in the business lurch, often struggling to receive a prompt reply from their agents regarding their importations. DocShipper’s founders saw this as an opportunity to connect with individuals, SMEs and Key Accounts on a global scale. DocShipper’s business model is based on three pillars designed to integrate the trading process for companies across the world. These pillars are:Marketing: DocShipper focuses on digital marketing to connect with customers on a global scale, as opposed to relying on established connections, which favours larger organisations. Digital marketing allows DocShipper to be highly visible online, take on more customers and communicate effectively across borders. Proactive customer service: DocShipper enlists local experts, implements scalable processes and CRM technology to deliver better service to their clients. Customers can easily connect with them at any stage via a number of digital channels. Network: DocShipper has an established network of trusted suppliers and agents operating across its international footprint. In each of its forty markets, DocShipper incorporates reputable shipping companies, suppliers and warehouses.  A flexible, secure and fast international payment experience powered by AirwallexDocShipper was searching for a payment provider that would allow them to operate on a global scale from day one. Traditional banks were concerned about DocShipper’s larger digital marketing investment - something unheard of in the antiquated freight forwarding industry.Finding an international payment partner was proving difficult initially, as the founding team required a solution that would allow them to make and receive international transactions on a global scale.This is where they found Airwallex and its product that allowed them to operate globally out of their Hong Kong headquarters with ease. Airwallex immediately provided DocShipper with AU, EU, HK, UK and US accounts, which enabled them to make and receive global payments from day one.“That is what we like about Airwallex: the fact that we can have different currency accounts in different countries,” says Pierre Rahme, Founder and Head of Sourcing for DocShipper. “We can reduce the cost of the transfer for all our customers and, especially, trade in different currencies.”Airwallex made it easy for DocShipper to host accounts in their key markets. This not only helps to reduce the cost of transfer for all their customers, it also allows them to trade in different currencies – a flexibility that traditional banks were not able to offer. What’s more, DocShipper’s clients feel comfortable with the knowledge that they are making payments to a local bank account without extra charges. Traditional freight forwarding and suppliers typically request payments to foreign bank accounts, which can be a deterrent for business owners.Finally, Airwallex was able to help DocShipper manage client payments across multiple countries. International shipping often requires businesses to make payments to multiple countries in different currencies for one project, and this can cause huge headaches for agents when it comes to managing these payments.Airwallex’s global accounts product allows DocShipper to accept customer payments in multiple currencies and countries given the nature of the project, and this has given DocShipper an advantage over competitors that utilise traditional bank transfers. “Airwallex is allowing us to be able to put our money into different currencies in one click,” Hochet adds. What’s ahead for DocShipper?2021 is expected to be a year of outstanding growth for DocShipper. The company plans to hire more staff and further expand in existing and new locations while maintaining high visibility online.“Growth, branding and expansion - that’s what we want for 2021.” Says Hochet. When asked for his advice on how to grow across borders, he emphasises the importance to understand the requirements of expansion before undertaking the process. ""Make sure you have the right people surrounding you in your core team who know what the company is about. Also, ensure you keep a good relationship with your partners, and that you understand the legal aspects of your expansion.”Finally, Hochet believes maintaining the balance is key to upholding high quality service throughout a period of growth. “Keep the balance throughout your expansion so that you can continue to provide the best possible customer service experience in end-to-end supply.""As the brothers always say: “Time is money, we save you both!""Related article: Deliciou’s journey from bacon seasoning to big businessBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/building-a-trusted-global-financial-cloud,How Airwallex is building a trusted global financial cloud with banking partners,"BlogHow Airwallex is building a trusted global financial cloud with banking partners23 February 2021•6 minutesBusiness tipsThe confluence of technology, cultural shifts, alongside regulatory changes has resulted in a rapid period of growth and innovation for the global banking ecosystem. Transactions are no longer managed by incumbent banks and organisations alone, but a complex network of ADIs (authorised deposit-taking institution), neobanks and fintechs all working together to create a better payments experience for businesses large and small. For far too long, the business world has lagged behind consumers in their adoption of technology. At Airwallex, we are building a new, global infrastructure layer - combining the best products in the market with our own proprietary technology - that connects with domestic payment, clearing and settlement networks across the world, enabling businesses of all sizes to make and receive payments. To put it simply, we make cross-border transactions fast, easy and secure.  Welcome to the digital evolution!Much of our products and services are made possible by our network of global, regional, and local banking partners, helping to power our local payout and settlement capabilities. With their deep local expertise and institutional knowledge, these banking partners have helped us identify new market opportunities, build an extensive geographical payments coverage, and reduce our cost through direct connectivity to local clearing networks.With competition for customer transactions higher than ever, banks stand to unlock new high-growth opportunities by working with established fintechs, helping to accelerate business profitability and capitalise on new payments innovations (developed quickly by fintechs). At Airwallex, our extensive global financial network and large product suite allow us to best support the needs of banks who are looking to grow their digital ecosystem.Why should banks work with Airwallex?1. We constantly innovate, bringing new alternatives to financial productsWe regularly launch new products and features in response to growing customer demand. To help businesses manage cash flow and expenses within a remote workforce for example, we introduced multi-currency virtual Visa cards (launched in a matter of months) last year. This solution allows businesses to create dedicated virtual cards with secure logins for different teams, functions and employees. Access to innovative payment products has seen consumer confidence in fintechs continue to grow. In the personal finance space alone, there has been a huge uptake with mobile banking becoming the norm. A recent report from McKinsey found that 73% of consumers are using digital banking services. This awareness has flowed into business banking, with customers now anticipating innovative financial solutions through partnerships. 2. We have a deep understanding of market needsWe take a collaborative approach to our banking relationships based on trust, market knowledge and mutual benefit. This means staying on top of both existing and upcoming regulations in all the markets our partners operate in. Our roots in Asia-Pacific and some of the most dynamic, growth markets of the world mean we recognise the complexities that are specific to individual markets, as well as navigating across multiple jurisdictions. Before entering any new market, we conduct intensive due diligence on the local regulatory environment, including market specifics like foreign currency controls, tax implications and restrictions around specific industries. These requirements are then integrated into our broader network. A practical example is the difference in domestic payment message formats. In countries like Japan and China, the use of local language characters is required. In other jurisdictions, the length of the reference fields can vary depending on the payment and underlying documentation needed for compliance. We work closely with our banking partners to create workflows for seamless integration and implementation, while always meeting local requirements and regulations. This takes the stress of navigating complex payment systems from our clients, so they can focus on growing their business.3. We maintain the highest degree of compliance to keep banking relationships secureThe secret to any successful long-term partnership is trust. In the case of financial partnerships, we build trust through our robust compliance framework that not only meets regulatory requirements, but also meets any specific obligations of our banking partners, regardless of where they operate. We promote open and transparent conversations with banking partners on a regular basis, to discuss the existing compliance program and make changes where necessary. This runs alongside our efforts to continuously improve processes and controls through training, automated transaction monitoring and a robust KYC program. As fintechs innovate to make financial services more accessible and convenient, financial crimes have also become more sophisticated and harder to detect. The challenge usually lies in ensuring a robust framework that meets or exceeds regulatory requirements, without compromising user experience and scalability. To this end, Airwallex has developed an automated, data-driven transaction monitoring system based on customer behaviour and account activity. The system uses machine learning technology, while also allowing for manual intervention where necessary. This has significantly improved our efficiency, security, and helped to minimise human intervention in the process.Get in touch todayWhether it's enhancing global connectivity or adding local payment support, we are fortunate to work alongside banking partners which enable us to empower businesses to operate anywhere, anytime. Our global Financial Partnerships team at Airwallex - based in three continents - is dedicated to continuously growing and strengthening our global financial network.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/3-key-brexit-implications-for-ecommerce,3 Key Brexit Implications For eCommerce Businesses,"Blog3 Key Brexit Implications For eCommerce Businesses22 February 2021•4 minsE-commerceBusiness tipsIn this article•What’s Brexit? •Collecting UK VAT•Filling out more paperwork 						•Expect shipping and processing delays 						Authored by Tom Mercer, Director of Bean Ninjas Europe.Did you know that the UK is the 4th largest eCommerce market in the world?As you likely know by now, the UK voted to leave the EU in the summer of 2016. However,  many eCommerce businesses - in the UK and around the world - are just now starting to feel the impact of Brexit. In this post, we’re taking a look at three of the biggest implications and what sellers can do, including: What’s Brexit?Collecting UK VATFilling out more paperworkExpect shipping and processing delaysWhat’s Brexit? Simply put, the UK voted to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016. This started a four-year transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. We won’t go into all of the details around Brexit. However, the two biggest ramifications are around:  Trade - There are no regulations and taxes for all goods being imported and exported into the UK. We’ll get to the three biggest implications of this later in this article.  Labor - This effectively ends the freedom for UK nationals to work and live in the EU. Now, UK citizens need a visa if they plan to live and work in the UK for more than 90 days. Collecting UK VATThis is the biggest change and will have the farthest-reaching effects. Now, any business that is importing goods worth more than £135 has to collect and pay Valued Added Tax - a.ka. VAT- upon entry into the UK. For goods that cost less, you can add it to your next VAT return. If you decide to pay this fee directly to your customers, this could have a negative impact on overall conversion rates (and sales) at checkout. For many others, who may choose to eat the costs themselves, this impacts your profit margins not only on a per-product/SKU but also overall business profitability. Pro Tip: Make sure to review your P&L statement before you decide to absorb any new fees - like VAT. Regardless of whether you absorb the fee yourself or pass it off to your customers, make sure to update your tax settings in your eCommerce platform. This will ensure your data is up-to-date when it is passed onto your cloud accounting software, such as Xero. Filling out more paperwork 						In fact, collecting VAT is only part of the story. In order to even import goods into the UK, all international sellers now need to apply for a UK VAT number - if you don’t have one already. This can be a time-consuming process - especially for smaller eCommerce businesses. In order to apply, you need to fill out a bunch of paperwork. Once you have a VAT number, you’ll also need to get an EORI number.  This can take anywhere from a week to a few months to ensure that you have everything set up and are fully compliant with the UK government. In addition, anytime you import items into the UK, there will be border checks and increased tariffs, which can add to your administrative burden. Expect shipping and processing delays 						With the increased administrative burden for eCommerce businesses and UK VAT, it should come as no surprise that there are now increased border checks for all items being imported and exported. This is leading to significant shipping delays due to backlogs at customs. For international sellers, who are mainly selling to UK customers, this mainly manifests in longer delivery times. We recommend being more proactive with your UK customers to manage expectations around shipping and delivery timeframes. This can build your trust and credibility while reducing the number of negative customer reviews and refund requests. For businesses that are based in the UK or have a UK warehouse, the impacts of shipping delays can have far-reaching logistical and financial ramifications. In addition to managing customer expectations, you are also juggling supply chain logistics since these processing delays will also impact any shipments to your warehouse. You’ll want to consider the impact on increased lead times when you are doing inventory forecasting and/or deciding when to order more products. Let’s take an example. If you run an eCommerce business selling gourmet dairy-free ice cream, your products require special care when shipping to customers, including refrigeration. This means that being held up in customs for an extra day could mean that your customers might end up with ice cream soup or, worse, ice cream that has gone bad if it wasn’t packaged to withstand these delays. In sum, the implications of Brexit are having a ripple effect for all eCommerce businesses - not just those based in the UK.Tom is an ACCA certified accountant with over 6 years of diverse experience working as a remote accountant all over the world.

In this content series, we sit down with our talented team to talk about why they're excited to work at Airwallex, their passions and what gets them out of bed in the morning! Introducing Andrew Foo, Legal Counsel located in Singapore. Tell us about your legal career to date - what inspired you to become a lawyer?It all started when I picked up To Kill a Mockingbird - cliché, but true! I have the same initials as Atticus Finch (the lead character in the novel, who bravely defends a black man accused of murdering a white lady), so I thought I could follow in his footsteps. Also, the law allows me to marry the craftsmanship of the arts with the causative logic of the sciences.Therefore, I decided to leave Singapore to read law in the UK. I then got qualified, first in England and then in Singapore, and have worked in both countries as well.Before joining Airwallex, I spent 8 years working in private practice - primarily in dispute resolution, representing and defending governments and MNCs in high-stakes disputes before judges, arbitrators, and mediators from around the world.Andrew at the Singapore Supreme Court after being called to the barWhat has been your proudest moment of your career so far?One of the things I’d love to tell my grandkids about one day, God-willing, is my appointment by the Singapore Supreme Court as a pro bono amicus curiae (that’s a lot of Latin - literally, a volunteer ‘friend of the Court’).  I was delighted to be appointed, as the selection process is rigorous, covering candidates’ academics, experience, legal analysis skills, and recommendations by judges and senior lawyers.I have since been approached to assist the Court on a human trafficking case. My role is to serve as a non-partisan lawyer, tackling novel and cutting-edge legal issues. It’s been both a joy and an honour to be involved.After your 7 plus years working at top tier law firms, why did you join Airwallex, a high-growth fintech? One word - growth.I am indebted to my former colleagues and mentors for helping me grow as a lawyer.  I had invaluable opportunities to learn from and work alongside the brightest and best - some of whom are Queen’s Counsel, Senior Counsel, law professors, and sitting judges in the UK and Singapore.But when Airwallex approached me to be the first legal counsel in Singapore, it hit the sweet spot - this was a high-growth company, where I could grow professionally in new and diverse ways - and also a company meaningfully tackling some of the growing pains of the global economy, where I can (I hope) do my part.What’s it like working in the Airwallex Singapore office? It’s been a hoot getting to know the talented and driven Singapore team, and settling into our new digs at Grace Global Raffles.  It definitely helps that we have a foosball table (where I’ve been able to squeeze out wins against Edwin (BD Director) and Royce (Talent Acquisition Specialist), and a La Marzocco espresso machine, which is a neat reference to our Tukk & Co beginnings.Some members of the Singapore team (left to right) Elodie Trichet, Andrew Foo, Edwin Lee, Jee Lee Koh & Royce LimThe location is great too - as Elodie (Head of Financial Partnerships, APAC) would enthusiastically affirm, we are a hop, skip, and a jump away from Lao Pa Sat - a 120 year old bastion of Singapore hawker culture, which was recently officially recognised by the UNESCO heritage committees. What is one myth about lawyers that you’d like to debunk?That we are all mercenary, politicking creatures ala Suits!  I’ve met many lawyers who conduct themselves with integrity, and would go the extra mile for the right cause or client.What advice would you give someone in the legal or compliance industry who is considering a job at a high-growth fintech? The fintech industry is one where the technology, products, and regulations are currently undergoing significant evolution and growth.  Joining a high-growth fintech is a surefire way to challenge yourself, and to be a part of - and contribute to - that growth.Who would play you in a movie about your life? I would love to play myself, if it ever got to that stage!  I’ve dabbled in amateur productions in the past, including Nativity plays and summer camp skits for children. I didn’t do terribly well, but I would hope I can at least accurately portray myself!  Related article: Employee Airtime with Account Manager Yvia Magan-ParkerLooking for the next step in your career?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/airwallex-and-cpa-australia-fintech-report,"Businesses missing the benefits of fintech, say Airwallex and CPA Australia","BlogBusinesses missing the benefits of fintech, say Airwallex and CPA Australia10 February 2021•6 minsBusiness tipsFinanceGlobal fintech unicorn Airwallex and Australia’s leading professional accounting body CPA Australia, launched the ‘The Role of FinTech in Modernising Businesses’ report today, which aims to educate businesses on emerging fintech solutions, and ultimately drive fintech adoption. 
In August 2020, Airwallex and CPA Australia surveyed 600 CPA members working in finance and accounting across businesses in Asia Pacific (APAC) to evaluate the current state of fintech adoption. Based on the survey results, the report aims to address current barriers to fintech adoption and help businesses understand the benefits of fintech solutions in modernising their businesses. 
Despite increasing digital adoption in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey revealed that only a third of businesses in the region have actively adopted fintech solutions. Additionally, a majority of businesses continue to have unmet business banking needs.

Survey results
According to the survey, businesses across APAC cited high banking fees (48 per cent), slow and manual service delivery (35 per cent) and the inability to set up global bank accounts (29 per cent) as the top pain points by businesses.

Cybersecurity concerns top the list of reasons why businesses are yet to apply fintech solutions, with more than half (53 per cent) stating this is a key barrier for adopting tech solutions to manage their financial needs. This was closely followed by data privacy concerns (48 per cent), and reliability and trust (48 per cent).
Summary of key findings70 per cent of APAC businesses surveyed have not used any fintech solutions 
40 per cent of APAC businesses are unaware of fintech and the benefits it offers
High banking fees (48 per cent), slow and manual service delivery (35 per cent) and inability to set up global bank accounts (29 per cent) were cited as the top unmet needs by businesses
48 per cent of respondents surveyed expressed cybersecurity, data privacy and trust concerns 
Australia is leading APAC in familiarity and awareness of fintech benefits: 61 per cent of Australian CPA members surveyed having familiarity with the fintech options available for SME and enterprises (as compared with Hong Kong at 57 per cent, Malaysia at 56 per cent and Singapore at 54 per cent)
Australia is leading APAC in fintech usage
: 39 per cent of Australian-based CPA members surveyed have used at least one or more fintech (as compared with Hong Kong at 36 per cent, Singapore at 28 per cent and Malaysia at 20 per cent).
Quotes
Neil Luo, VP, Global Head of SME at Airwallex, said, “Fintech has transformed the global economy, creating new revenue streams and operating efficiencies so businesses large and small can remain viable in an increasingly competitive environment. However, today’s data shows low fintech adoption rates, highlighting a huge missed opportunity for businesses across the region in realising the benefits fintech has to offer. Many of the key business pain points - including opening accounts overseas, being charged high FX fees on foreign transactions and inability to issue employees with their own cards - can be alleviated or resolved through fintechs such as Airwallex.“At Airwallex, our digital payment solutions have enabled many businesses - from startups to large-scale enterprises - to grow in every corner of the world, while saving time and money doing so. We have earned our customers’ trust and confidence by ensuring that their transactions are not only fast and seamless but also secure. However, we understand education is key to greater fintech adoption, and look forward to working alongside CPA Australia in supporting accountants and the businesses they serve.” Luo continued.
Gavan Ord, Manager Business and Investment Policy and Asia Policy Lead at CPA Australia, said,
 “Australian businesses are falling behind their international counterparts when it comes to the uptake of fintech solutions. The current business environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic has made digital technologies more essential than ever before. 
“Many of our members support clients who need help transforming into digital-first businesses. CPA Australia supports initiatives that encourage small businesses to undertake digital transformation. With the right technology, businesses can improve their agility in this highly competitive environment.” Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

In ACCC’s recent report, Australian businesses spent 28% of their total online advertising budget on Facebook in 2019, representing a 16% growth from the previous year.With the accelerated shift to online shopping crowding out the online advertising space, it is vital for every business to utilise each marketing dollar to its full capability. This includes every dollar spent on hidden transaction fees on top of your Facebook advertising costs.How to check if your Facebook ad spend has hidden bank feesDespite Facebook charging and invoicing you in AUD, many businesses are paying an additional 3% in foreign transaction fee for this spend. Eliminating these fees may provide an additional $3,000 re-invested back into your business on a $100,000 Facebook ad budget.
The Big 4 Australian banks including CBA, NAB, ANZ and Westpac charge a 3% foreign transaction fee on many of their business card products, which typically applies on transactions charged in a foreign currency.
However, this also applies to transactions where the merchant or entity processing the transaction is located outside of Australia, which applies to Facebook. Even if the transaction is in AUD. This is because foreign transactions are actually defined by where the merchant is located, not by the currency they are charging in. Which is why most bank card fee schedules come with this statement:
“International transactions are transactions where the merchant, financial institution or entity processing the transaction is located outside Australia. Note: It may not always be clear to you that the Merchant or entity processing the transaction is located outside Australia.”
The merchant’s location is formally defined as part of their Merchant of Record (MoR). Unfortunately, this information is not available to the public. This makes it difficult to know upfront if you’ll be charged a foreign transaction fee, with many businesses taking a trial and error process instead.
It’s worth checking your card statements for international transaction fees or speaking to your finance team, as it’s possible you’re forfeiting an additional 3%, on top of your ad spend, that could instead be invested in growth.

Win back your Facebook ads budget from international transaction feesIt’s not possible to simply change Facebook’s merchant location to be within Australia to avoid being charged the 3% fee. The simpler solution is to eliminate these international card transaction fees entirely.The good news is that not all card issuers charge international card transactions fees.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-price-your-product,How to Price and Promote your Product for International Markets,"BlogHow to Price and Promote your Product for International Markets22 January 2021•8 minutesE-commerceIn this article•Why Pricing and Promotions are Crucial for eCommerce•Top Ways to Price Your Product (Pros and Cons)•How Your Promotions Will Impact Your Pricing Strategy•How Your Pricing and Promotions Strategy Needs to Change in International MarketsProduct pricing is an essential element in determining the success of your eCommerce products. But often, businesses only consider pricing as an afterthought - they settle and use the first price that comes to mind, copy competitor pricing, or (worst of all) just guess. This post will provide you with the pricing strategies you need to create a reliable, international pricing structure for your products. 
Why Pricing and Promotions are Crucial for eCommerceDo you know what the most important feature that drives purchase decisions is? You guessed right: pricing. In fact, 80% of buyers say that competitive pricing is the most critical store feature that drives purchasing decisions. Moreover, over 90% of online shoppers say they compare deals on the internet before purchasing. And 59% of online shoppers search for discounts before buying. Clearly, price is an essential buying factor for consumers. But humans are irrational, and many subconscious factors drive purchase decisions. The reason Rolls Royce can get $300,000-$500,000 per car isn’t that they have materials worth that price tag - they’re selling reputation.BrandYour business's brand is one of those nebulous things that’s hard to quantify. But it’s your most important asset. Your brand determines whether your products will sell at a discount or a premium.Customer ExpectationsCustomers have price expectations about your products before they visit your store and other stores. Their decision on whether or not to buy is driven by the perceived gain or loss that they experience. The difference between price expectations and actual price is crucial to consider when planning pricing and promotion strategies. Using Price to Manage Stock & InventoryPricing is intricately related to demand and supply. Generally, to control your stock levels, you should increase prices when you have a shortage and decrease costs when you have a surplus. Top Ways to Price Your Product (Pros and Cons)Because pricing is so intricately tied to your business’s KPIs and overall success, you need a pricing strategy.Here are the top ways to price your product:
Cost-plus pricing and markup (simple markup)One of the simplest ways to price your product is cost-plus pricing.Cost-based pricing is straightforward. You calculate the total cost it takes to produce your product, then add a markup in the form of a percentage to determine the final price. 
For example, let’s say you’ve created a product with the following costs:Material costs = $30Labour costs = $10Overhead = $10Total Costs = $50
Then, you add your markup percentage. Let’s say it’s a 50 percent markup, known as keystone and a standard in the retail industry, according to Entrepreneur. To calculate the final price, you would take the total cost of $50 and multiply it by 1.50, giving a retail price of $75. If you wanted to throw in a little psychological pricing, you could add .99 to make it $75.99 or even $79.99. Competitive pricing (match competitors)Competitive pricing, also referred to as market-oriented pricing, compares similar products from competitors in the same market. You set your product’s price higher or lower than your competitors, depending on how your product matches up to your competitors. Here are the three strategies you can take for competitive pricing:Price above your competitors: Intentionally pricing your product above your competitors to brand yourself as having a higher-quality product. Copy market: Selling your item at the same price as your competitors to stay competitive and maximize profit.Price below your competitors: Intentionally pricing your product below your competitors to attract price-sensitive customers to you instead of your competitors.Premium pricing (building a premium brand)Premium pricing is a strategy that involves pricing your products above your immediate competition. The purpose of premium pricing is to position your brand as being just that bit higher in quality than the rest. Remember the example on Rolls Royce? Many luxury brands use premium pricing to set high prices and keep them there. The best way to incorporate a premium into your pricing strategy is to emphasize the subconscious drivers that make customers buy your products. The benefits of premium pricing are obvious - you increase profit margins and position your brand as reputable and valuable. But you could also be voluntarily pricing out some of your market share and leaving yourself vulnerable to undercutting from your competitors. How Your Promotions Will Impact Your Pricing StrategyMany factors will directly affect your product’s pricing. It’s vital that you view your pricing strategy as something fluid and transforming instead of something static. Prices that fluctuate and change with the market, seasons, and global eCommerce dates will increase revenue and decrease consumer surplus. Seasonal sales and promotions are one of the best ways to attract more customers to your eCommerce store. Line pricing discountsA product line is a group of related products, differentiated by pricing and features. Setting products at different price points allows your customers to purchase products most likely to fit their needs and purchasing power. Line pricing discounts allow you to position your products with the best features and quality at high price points while keeping a base product on sale as a lower-priced alternative. A great example of this is clothing. Outlets are likely to have product lines based on the material and tailoring quality of different items of clothing. If you had a product line consisting of leather jackets, faux leather jackets, and canvas jackets in the same collection, they would all have different prices to make the quality differentials obvious. Free gifts for minimum spend (boost AOV)One of the best ways to increase your eCommerce store’s overall health is to boost your average order value (AOV). And one of the best ways to get your customers to make larger purchases is to provide something free in exchange for a minimum spend. This could be a free gift, free delivery, or a discount code for their next purchase. One of the biggest deal-breakers for online shoppers is hidden shipping costs that appear in the last stage of their buyer’s journey. Offering free shipping with a minimum spend is a great way to increase AOV and revenue. BundlingBundling is self-explanatory: it simply means bundling together various items to sell them as a product kit. If you have a set of items that can be sold separately but sell better together, why not go ahead and group them together into more easily consumable collections?Bundling helps increase your store's efficiency by decreasing marketing and distribution costs. A product bundling strategy can significantly increase profits, and it’s also a great way to increase your average order value.Note: Australian eCommerce brand BedHead Hats increased their AOV by 100% through bundling. Volume-based discountsA volume-based discount or quantity-discount is offered by sellers to incentivize customers to make larger purchases. Now, the question is: how much should you discount for a given quantity? To keep track of things, you need a discount schedule that outlines amounts and percentages. For example, for 30 pieces of an item, a customer qualifies for a 10% discount, 60 pieces of an item qualify for 20%, and so on. How Your Pricing and Promotions Strategy Needs to Change in International MarketsFor international markets, pricing is one of the essential elements of your marketing. Consumers in different markets have different perceptions of your products, so you need to consider these things:Different base pricing expectations for your product category In the first section, we touched on how customers have price expectations about your products before visiting your store and how it affects their purchasing decisions. Now, when selling in international markets, you have to take the pricing expectations of consumers in your target market into serious consideration. A consumer in China will likely have a radically different pricing expectation than an Australian consumer for the same product.So how do you determine what consumers in your target market are expecting to pay? You either test the market using different channels and pricing points or you do market research and analyze the price points your competitors are selling at. Different promotion expectationsGlobal eCommerce dates differ in countries around the world. That means your promotions and pricing should reflect and take into account these key dates. An essential but often-overlooked detail when selling in international markets is the fact that many holidays and seasonal dates are celebrated on different days in different parts of the world. Here are some examples of key days that differ across countries:While Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the top shopping dates in the US and the Western world, Singles day is the leading shopping date in China and Asia. Since you’re reading this, make sure you grab our global eCommerce calendar to plan your promotions throughout the year!Re-evaluating your pricing and promotions strategyAs we mentioned earlier, your pricing strategy isn’t static. It’s a fluid, fluctuating thing that needs to change according to the context to maximize profits. It’s not just okay to re-evaluate your pricing: it’s a necessity. Lucky for you, we built this calculator to help you experiment with your pricing!Experiment on the impact of different promotions on your marginOnce you’ve crunched the numbers on your margins, you can use the promotion tool to see how promotions like discounts, free gifts, and bundling impact your bottom line.Want to learn more?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/digital-business-bank-account-benefits,The benefits of a digital business bank account,"BlogThe benefits of a digital business bank account18 January 2021•4 minutesFinanceIn this article•What is a digital bank?•How do digital business bank accounts differ from traditional business bank accounts?•The top 5 benefits of a digital business bank account•An Airwallex Global Business Account is a better banking alternative In an increasingly digital world, how we bank is evolving. You might have heard about digital banks. In this article, we look at what these innovative new platforms are, and how they can help you with your business’ finances.
What is a digital bank?A digital bank isn’t just an online bank account. It’s a banking organisation that operates solely online. There are no branch locations in the real world, no physical presence, and no physical banking infrastructure.All your account management and banking activities are done purely online, either in-browser or via the digital bank’s app.Digital banks are capitalising on the rise of technology made for the digital world, and are doing a good job of disrupting the banking industry through customer-first feature releases, competitive pricing and industry-leading technology.How do digital business bank accounts differ from traditional business bank accounts?As a member of a digital bank, your bank account exists entirely online. All of it. From your data trail to your paperwork, and your money. Your relationship with your digital banks starts online, and stays online. 
This also means that you access self-service for your account online, too. You usually don’t need to check things off with a person in the real world or provide hard copies of documents (a bonus of which enables you to bank paper-free).
The top 5 benefits of a digital business bank accountThere are plenty of things to love about a digital business bank account. We’ve ranked the 5 key benefits that make digital business bank accounts an outstanding choice for your finances.
1. It’s quick and easy to open an online bank accountYou don’t need to visit a branch, speak to an advisor, or have physical copies of your identification checked. Opening an online bank account with a digital bank is a completely online process. You don’t need to go into a branch during the not-quite-business hours that traditional banks operate under, or interact with another human being in any manner. Once you’ve signed up to your digital bank, you can open a digital business account directly through their app, using nothing but your smartphone. All it takes is a few taps, entering some personal information, and your online bank account will be up and running.
2. 24/7 banking, with more self-service functionalityA digital business account means you can do your banking 24/7. No waiting until the banks open, no ducking out during work hours. You can access your account when you need it.And, as digital banks are designed to be used online, they’ve made the user experience easier, too. All the functionalities you need from a bank will be laid out clearly and concisely in their app or browser interface—including customer service.
3. Enjoy lower costs all roundDigital banks cut out a lot of things that traditional banks require to run. As such, digital banks are paying a lot less overheads. Less, or no, rent, fewer staff salaries, less costs on office equipment and utilities—all the costs of existing in the physical world.
The fact that all your money transfers, bill payments, and general financial transactions are completed digitally removes the human element, while also removing the cost of human labour. 
And, as cheesy as it sounds, they’re able to pass these savings on to you, the customer, in the form of lower account fees. Or in some cases, no account fees at all.
4. Enhanced securityDigital banks are built with digital needs in mind, so they take extra care with their digital security. Tools like two-factor authentication provide an added layer of safety around your banking, so you’ll always know when someone unwarranted is trying to access your account. And, as you’ll likely be banking via an app on your smartphone, two-factor authentication will be a breeze.
5. Better visibility and easier reconciliationBecause digital banks are, well, digital, they run purely on code. This code can be integrated into the code of other platforms. Platforms like cloud accounting software such as Xero, digital signature and contract management systems, or money lending and international trading platforms.
Digital banks are streamlining how we do banking, and creating opportunities to merge financial worlds for one easier process. You get better visibility across all your financials, and as your integrations are synced to one another, your reconciliation process can happen automatically.
How to make the most of your online bank accountIt pays to set your online bank accounts up correctly in the first instance, to avoid any future hassles. 
Set up two-factor authentication, and ensure a secure passwordMuch like your Gmail or ATO online portal identification, your digital business bank will likely have the option to set up two-factor authentication. This simple process enables you to control who accesses your account. The authentication might be sent to your smartphone via text, delivered in an email, go directly to your app, or to a specific authentication app on your phone.And it shouldn’t be something we need to reiterate, but it is: be sure to set a secure password for your online bank accounts. Use a unique password across all your accounts, making use of numbers, symbols, and different cases.You can condense all your passwords into a password manager app if you need. But taking the time to create a secure password is one of the first lines of defence against fraud; it’s a no-brainer.
Invest the time upfront to set up your accountMake your digital business bank account work for you by taking the time upfront to set up all the necessary users, with the corresponding levels of authority. Then, determine which banking integrations you already use, and which ones you should be using, and ensure they can integrate with your digital bank account.This will make your digital business account run smoothly from the get-go.But if you want an even better way to manage your digital banking, Airwallex has you covered.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-our-security-and-compliance-works-to-protect-your-transactions,How our security and compliance works to protect your transactions,"BlogHow our security and compliance works to protect your transactions15 January 2021•4 minsBusiness tipsGuidesIn this article•So, what is compliance and why is it important?  •How we protect our customersBy Jeanette Chan, Chief Legal, Compliance and Risk Officer at AirwallexFor businesses of all sizes - from startups to large-scale enterprises - the global pandemic has completely transformed how we do business in the modern digital economy. Consumers are now shopping online in record numbers, with a recent McKinsey report finding digital marketplaces like Amazon are expected to account for about 60% of digital-commerce volume in the next few years.The rise in digital transactions has increased both adoption and trust in newer digital financial services. At Airwallex, we’ve seen a 50 per cent increase in our global customer base in the last two quarters of 2020. However, this trust cannot be taken for granted. New opportunities also bring complex security challenges that governments, regulators and financial services organisations have to manage swiftly and effectively. At Airwallex, we take our commitment to upholding and complying to legal and regulatory requirements very seriously. That’s why compliance remains at the heart of everything we do. You may be thinking; what is compliance, and more importantly, how do you keep my transactions safe? Here, we want to answer these questions, and highlight how Airwallex ensures your transactions are fast, seamless and secure. So, what is compliance and why is it important?  In one year, it’s estimated that financial crime costs the global economy between US$800 billion and US$2 trillion (2-5% of global GDP). To meet these challenges, compliance and operations teams - like the global teams at Airwallex - work to ensure the movement of money is transparent, fair and efficient through five key areas of responsibility: monitoring, detection, investigation, prevention and advisory. In addition, regulators authorise and oversee the compliance laws for each region, changing and improving rules where necessary. These bodies work together to protect transactions and the integrity of the global financial system against crime like money laundering and terrorism financing as criminals and terrorist syndicates attempt to move illicit funds around the world.   How we protect our customersOur approach to compliance has enhanced over the years. Since joining the company in 2019, I have endeavoured to build and lead a global legal and compliance team with the best combination of: Comprehensive regulatory, compliance, risk and legal expertise and experienceMembers with agile and adaptable mindsets to advise and manage rapid changes in financial products, services and technologiesGrounded on the core values required to always make the right decision These values are central to the strength of our legal and compliance team. We promote a unified approach with all members working as one, sharing information and contributing to the growth of the Group as a whole.For our customers, we are committed to providing agile and innovative solutions that grow alongside them and their businesses, while ensuring security and compliance remains at the centre of our services and infrastructure. Although Airwallex is not a bank, in many crucial aspects, we are regulated just like a bank. As such, there are a number of ways we protect our customers:  A deep compliance understanding in every region: Today, we have lawyers and compliance officers in every jurisdiction in which we operate, focusing on the regulatory and financial crime aspects of compliance. Our global teams work as an integrated unit to maintain the highest legal, regulatory and compliance standards.Automated transaction monitoring: We use a data-driven transaction monitoring system which provides alerts based on customer behavior and account activity. Our monitoring can be tailored to new situations and compliance requirements quickly and efficiently. Know Your Customer (KYC): All our customers are subject to our comprehensive KYC process where we collect the necessary information to understand account purposes and potential red flags.  Working with trusted partners: To be the global financial infrastructure of the digital economy, we work with trusted partners in the financial ecosystem, such as Visa and Mastercard. These organisations help us provide faster and more secure cross-border payments for our customers.  Training: Airwallex requires all employees to undergo risk and financial security training on at least an annual basis to ensure the appropriate level of awareness and knowledge within the organisation.We believe the industry and all relevant stakeholders - including governments, regulators, banks and fintechs - must promote working together to improve security and compliance measures for businesses and consumers. As we enter into new markets, we will continue innovating and improving our compliance strategy to uphold the highest of regulatory and compliance standards at all times.This underpins our core objective, to ensure we provide the most innovative global financial infrastructure to support our customers business needs, with security and compliance at the centre of each and every transaction.Related article: Building a Culture of Compliance that Empowers Businesses to Grow Without BordersBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs

It’s not a guessing game - It’s science. When marketers talk about metrics like ROI, CTR, response rates, conversion rates, and CPA, they’re doing so to gauge a campaign’s success.All of these metrics are useful. But if you don’t measure ROAS in addition to all the other metrics, you’re not getting the full picture of how effective your advertising dollars are. In other words, you don’t have a clear grasp of profitability directly attributed to your advertising campaigns. Without a clear grasp of your ROAS, it’s impossible to identify and determine which underperforming campaigns you should kill and which winning campaigns you should scale. As you can imagine, not killing an underperforming campaign early can be an expensive exercise. But on the flip side of that, pausing a campaign too early may give you an incomplete view of its performance. Over time, as you understand your ROAS across various advertising channels, you’ll be able to set benchmarks and avoid both of the situations described. You’ll also be able to forecast upcoming revenue based on the budget you have for ad spend. Lastly, ROAS is crucial when you plan to enter a new market as you’ll be able to test its commercial viability quickly by comparing your ROAS across local and international channels. This should result in significantly less ad spend as you won’t be committing resources to scale your cross-border advertising channels before validating that it will work. How to Calculate ROAS The equation to calculate your ROAS is simple. Here it is:The first part of the equation is straightforward. You want to be looking at total revenue attributed to the ad campaign. Now, to get an accurate insight into your campaigns’ effectiveness using ROAS, you need to take all your ad costs into account. What numbers should you include for the cost of ads? The ad spend itself will be the largest component of your costs. But there are some less obvious costs that you shouldn’t forget to include, such as:Agency costs: If you’re outsourcing your advertising to agencies, the fees and commissions should be included in your total ad costs. In-house salary costs: If you have an ad specialist in-house, you should include personnel costs.Affiliate Commissions: This should include payouts to affiliates and fees. Assess how effective your advertising spend is across countries today with your free copy of our International ROAS Calculator.What Is a Healthy ROAS?Your ROAS will vary depending on campaign, industry, and marketing goals. That means there is no single ‘acceptable’ ROAS. Generally, a ROAS of 4:1 is considered healthy - $4 in return for every $1 in ad spend. Of course, this is heavily dependent on your budget, profit margins, and overall business health. But the higher your ROAS, the better. Some businesses require a much higher ROAS to stay profitable, while others can grow substantially with a lower ROAS (3:1). It’s important to note that ROAS is a short-term metric. It assesses the performance of campaigns that run for a set period (usually a couple of weeks). When is a lower ROAS acceptable?There are many instances where a lower ROAS is acceptable. In the context of international expansion, businesses will often have a lower ROAS. Why? Because businesses breaking into new markets, have very little brand awareness.And the average consumer needs to see an ad 20 times before she’s sold, according to Thomas Smith’s Successful Advertising. Repetition was, is, and always will be the key to effective marketing. When breaking into a new market, chances are you’ll start with a lower ROAS and then move higher as your brand starts to get some traction. It’s difficult to quantify brand awareness, but brand is your most important asset, and you should view your initial campaigns in that light. 
How Does ROAS Change When Selling Cross-Border?As we mentioned, your ROAS from local advertising campaigns will differ from campaigns in other international markets. Many variables will affect your ROAS in new markets, including:The competitive landscape in your target marketForeign currency fees will drive up advertising costs  Click-Through Rates (CTR) will change as demand for products will be differentOn-site conversion rates will be impacted by your site’s localized customer experienceAverage Order Value (AOV) will change depending on the currency and how it converts overLower profit margin from additional international transfer fees when converting revenues back into AUD 
For the sake of clarity, let’s assume you’ve found a new target market and have optimized your store for all the above variables. Chances are, as you begin to ramp up your campaigns, you’ll see a lower ROAS. Initially, it will cost you more to acquire new customers. Ultimately, your international ROAS should come close to parity with your local market for your campaigns to be successful. Common pay-per-click (PPC) Marketing ChannelsWhen marketers talk about PPC marketing channels, they’re usually referring to Google ads - both the Search and Display networks. But these days, they could also be referring to Facebook ads. Google Search and Display NetworkGoogle’s search network is where PPC ads appear, above and below the organic search results for any search query. Google’s Display Network (GDN) is where display ads are shown across Gmail, YouTube, Google Finance, and all the websites and apps in the network. With Google’s Display Network, you have three different pricing options:CPC: You pay when someone clicks on your ad. This is best for driving traffic to your store’s website. Cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM): You pay for ad views. This is best for creating a buzz and driving awareness of your brand. Cost-per-acquisition (CPA): You pay when your ad leads to a conversion. This is best if you want people to take some form of action - whether it’s a purchase or other transaction. CPCs can vary widely in different industries and from one geographic location to another (even for similar search terms and keywords). Here’s a visual showing the average CPC around on Google by industry:Facebook and InstagramAs the world’s largest and most widely used social network, Facebook is a massive player in the online advertising world. Favoured by many eCommerce store owners who make a killing on Instagram, it’s not uncommon to find businesses advertising on both Facebook and Google. Facebook’s pricing model works very similarly to advertising on Google. Facebook does offer advertisers more flexibility with campaign objectives, but the costs can still be broken down into CPCs. Here are the average CPCs for Facebook by country, with the United Kingdom, Spain, and the United States as the three most expensive CPCs.

Overall, Facebook and Instagram ads perform exceptionally well and offer brilliant ROAS and ROI.  Especially for small-medium sized eCommerce businesses that sell niche products. There aren’t many ad platforms that offer a decent return on ad spend for smaller budgets - even $100 can go a long way with Facebook ads. 
How Can You Improve Your ROAS and ROI?To take a holistic view of your eCommerce store’s profitability, you need to be looking at both ROAS and ROI. What exactly is the difference? As we mentioned, ROAS looks at the return from your ad spend while ROI looks at the return on a particular investment, relative to the cost of the investment; it’s a ratio between your net profit and investment. You need both metrics to understand profitability. Now, many variables will impact your ROAS, but in general, you can improve it by focusing on these metrics:Lower your cost per click Optimise your ad creative by market, leverage customer reviews and make improvements to your targeting (e.g. keywords, audience and geographies)Increase your website conversion rateLocalise and optimise your online store (e.g. localised products, promotions, languages, currencies, payment methods and shipping options)

But Christmas is only one of the many active shopping days/seasons in the year that you should be capitalizing on. So we made this downloadable, month-to-month global retail promotion calendar with all the prime opportunities you don’t want to miss out on. Use it to help create winning strategies throughout the entire season! Why You Need to Plan Your Marketing Activities Around International Retail DatesWe’ll be shocked if you’re shocked: the holiday season drives some of the highest sales of the year for eCommerce brands. In fact, online holiday sales in the US have grown between 20% and 30% year-over-year in 2020 despite the pandemic, according to market research firm Forrester. And this trend is global. But there are other dates that benefit eCommerce brands and consumers alike. For example, International orders surge by over 35% before Black Friday. For businesses looking to convert unprecedented international retail dates into record-breaking growth, planning early and prioritizing online efforts are a must. For scaling eCommerce businesses, planning around these dates is a great way to test a new, international market. For established eCommerce businesses, preparing by localizing promotions strategies will unlock greater value without giving away value in regions.
Top Retail Events Differ Across Countries
Global eCommerce is taking off. While the US has dominated the global eCommerce market for the past decade, today China is the world's largest eCommerce market, and countries in Asia and Latin America are some of the fastest-growing eCommerce markets in the world. 
The best way to expand into these markets? Plan your marketing campaigns around key retail shopping dates and seasons in your target markets. An important but often-overlooked detail when selling cross-border is the fact that many holidays and seasonal dates are celebrated on different days in different parts of the world. Here are some examples of key online shopping days that differ across countries:While Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the top shopping dates in the US and the Western world, Singles day is the top shopping date in China and Asia. This year, US consumers spent a record-breaking $10.8B online on Cyber Monday, a 15% increase from 2019. To put that into perspective, Alibaba drove over $30B in sales both within China and across other markets on Singles day within a 24-hour period. As we mentioned, major holidays differ in different countries. Take Fathers day for example, which is celebrated on different dates even amongst countries in the Western world. So how do you tap into these Global eCommerce events?How to Tap into Global eCommerce EventsTo tap into global retail dates, you’ll need to plan your promotions to target key global retail dates throughout the year, including your marketing campaigns, inventory, and logistics.With global marketing campaigns, you should create personalized campaigns based on locations. This way, you can target customers by region to distribute your offers on key global retail dates. Note: Keep in mind that you should have all aspects of your website localized based on the location of your target consumers. Now, both your inbound and outbound campaigns should be tailored to specific geographic segments. For example, you could use geolocation pop-up banners on your website to target inbound customers visiting from specific countries with personalized offers. On the flipside, your outbound campaigns should also be personalized by distributing discount codes to specific customer segments via email or SMS marketing. Major International Retail Holidays for 2021 Jan - MarLate Jan (AU): Back to School7th Feb (US): Super Bowl Sunday14th Feb (Global): Valentine’s Day19th - 23rd Feb (UK): London Fashion Week8th March (Global): International Women’s Day14th March (UK): Mother’s Day

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/set-up-us-entity-for-your-ecommerce-business,Should you set up a US entity for your eCommerce business?,"BlogShould you set up a US entity for your eCommerce business?4 January 2021•6 minutesE-commerceBusiness tipsIn this article•What are the costs involved in setting up a US entity?•What are the tax implications of having a US entity?•Airwallex’s US Global Accounts can fast track your US expansion and simplify your global funds in a single placeThe United States represents the second largest cross-border eCommerce market in the world, with worth $586B in 2019. It’s no wonder many Australian eCommerce businesses are expanding into the United States.As your US sales and customer demand grow, it’s important / a natural question for business owners to assess if they should set up a separate US entity for their eCommerce business.“The main benefit for Australian businesses considering a US entity is receiving payouts in USD from their eCommerce platforms like Shopify, Stripe and others. The net benefit becomes significant especially for our eCommerce clients with USD500,000 annual sales from their US operations to justify the effort,” explains DanWhat are the costs involved in setting up a US entity?Once a business understands its potential cost savings from unnecessary currency conversions, it’s crucial to assess the cost and steps involved.Upfront set upThis process can take 2 - 3 months, and vary between USD$2,000 to USD$10,000 depending on the size and complexity of your eCommerce business.1. Incorporate your businessThere are a number of online incorporation services such as Stripe Atlas that help businesses set up a simple US entity for a flat fee. eCommerce business can also work with an experienced accountant and lawyer to set up the right structure.Your decision on your business entity type (e.g. Limited Liability Corporation, Limited Partnership or Corporation) and the state you incorporate under will have different implications on the state tax and registered agent requirements.Once you have decided on the right business entity and state of incorporation for your eCommerce business, you now need to set up your US phone number, a virtual office for a physical US address and apply for an  EIN number that will also be used to set up your US eCommerce accounts.2. Create the necessary intercompany agreementsOnce your US entity is set up, you will effectively have two separate entities. Having the right intercompany agreements during this setup ensures that you are meeting legal requirements when exchanging funds between these entities.There are two main types of intercompany agreements. First, a management services agreement sets out the appropriate fee that your US entity will pay to your ‘home’ entity for performing the majority of the management services required.Second, a licensing agreement that specifies any IP and trademarks your ‘home’ entity has and the licensing fee schedule that the US entity will adhere to.Ongoing requirements for your US entityWith a US entity, the ongoing effort and costs could be minimal with the right professional support and can range between USD$1,050 to USD$5,000.From your initial setup, you will need to pay the ongoing costs for your virtual office for a physical US address and your appointed registered agent fees. Alongside that, you will need an additional accounting software license or premium plan to support your US entity and USD transactions. For example, Xero’s Premium 5 plan supports multiple currencies.Each year, you will also need to file federal and state tax returns for your US entity with the help of a US tax accountant, as well as a state annual report to meet legal requirements. With the right professional support, this process does not need to be time-consuming.What are the tax implications of having a US entity?With a US entity, you are required to pay federal corporate taxes, in addition to the state-specific sales taxes. However, on average the corporate tax rates in the US are lower than in Australia. According to KPMG, the US average corporate tax rate in 2020 is 27% compared to Australia’s corporate tax rate of 30%.In addition to federal corporate taxes, your business will need to pay state-level sales taxes that vary for each state. However, even without a US entity, Australian businesses can be liable for sales tax under certain conditions where sales exceed a certain amount.It is important to consult a licensed US tax accountant to understand the tax implications as you are incorporating your US entity.Airwallex’s US Global Accounts can fast track your US expansion and simplify your global funds in a single placeOur mission at Airwallex is to help businesses of all sizes to do business without borders.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/employee-airtime-with-jed-rose-general-manager-for-emea,"Employee Airtime with Jed Rose, General Manager for EMEA","BlogEmployee Airtime with Jed Rose, General Manager for EMEA22 December 2020•5 minutesWhat was your first job? After graduating from Stanford, I was offered two exciting opportunities at Microsoft – one on Bill Gates’ speech writing team and one doing product management for Microsoft Windows. I chose the role in product management as it gave me the opportunity to see how a multi-billion dollar business operates and grows.  Since then, I have been applying this experience to high-growth startups to help them accelerate their impact and realise their global ambitions.What motivated you to join Airwallex? First and foremost, the people. In particular, I am really inspired by Jack and the whole management team, and anything is possible with a great team. Management support is particularly important as we build the team here in EMEA.Working remotely with the leadership teamSecondly, the technology platform. At Airwallex, we are building something truly revolutionary in supporting businesses to operate on a global scale anytime, anywhere. What makes Airwallex super exciting is that we’re changing something that's been broken for decades. The current international bank transfers and cross border payments system is over 50 years old. We have gone back to the whiteboard (in many areas of banking for businesses) to answer the question – how can we make this better for our customers?Finally, our investors. We are backed by some of the best investors in the world – including Sequoia Capital, DST Global, Salesforce Ventures, and Mastercard. Our recent Series D round allows us to deploy significant capital to our teams, products, and the right strategic priorities to accelerate overall impact.What are your three biggest focuses for EMEA? We have very strong growth plans in EMEA so my first focus is building the right team. At this stage we are about 12 people in size and we are tracking towards over 80 people by the end of 2021 – easily doubling our headcount in just the next few months. We are definitely keeping the HR team very busy!  The second area of focus for us is to create the best product experience for our customers. Being at a different stage of growth compared to other Airwallex markets, I see EMEA as a startup within a startup. While we’re focusing on products that are working in other regions, we are also listening to our local customers to understand what tweaks and features they need to grow. The third key priority for us is accelerating our growth and impact across EMEA by serving and supporting our existing business customers, growing our sales channels, fostering strategic partnerships and building a best-in-class customer experience that continues to improve over time.What’s your biggest career lesson?  Over my career, the biggest lesson has been the importance of alignment. During my time as CEO at my last startup, Paymentsense, which was rated as one of the top one-hundred fastest growing startups in the UK for three years in a row, alignment was key to this trajectory.This means ensuring teams are focused on the most important priorities for the long-term growth of the business. For example, having targets that the whole team can get behind, with each person confident in their individual role for supporting our bigger goals. Efforts must move in the same direction to maximise potential impact on what matters most to the business. What do you do for fun? I have been an investor in venture capital for eight years and serve as a Venture Partner for Antler, a global early-stage VC that supports entrepreneurs in 10 locations around the world. I have been fortunate enough to meet hundreds of the most exciting startups from across Europe. Professionally, this has provided me with further insights into startup lessons, failures and how to approach growth.Outside of work, I have been an avid off-piste skier (backcountry skiing) for many years now. I am certified for avalanche rescue training and am always prepared with a beacon, probe, and shovel – I also bring a drone to scout terrain as a safety precaution. During the winter, I head to the Alps. Once you get off the chairlift and hike for a bit, you can go downhill for two hours straight without seeing another person. I find it inspiring to be amongst friends, always challenging the mind and body.Surveying off-piste terrain by droneWhat does success look like to you? Long-term success for EMEA is living up to our vision to be the global financial cloud to empower businesses to operate anywhere, anytime.Our EMEA team is playing its own crucial part in our bigger journey to bring Airwallex around the globe to businesses everywhere. Sounds great – Thank you for your time!My pleasure. It was great chatting! Looking forward to providing an update on our progress as we grow from here.Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

•The Countries You Want to Target•Tailoring Your Content for Different Countries•Your Competition•Your Domain Structure•Hreflang Attributes - What You Need to Know•Final Thoughts •Complete your International eCommerce store set up with an Airwallex Global Business AccountWhat is international SEO and how does it differ from regular SEO? International SEO is the process of rolling out SEO campaigns to different countries, using a mix of different domain names, subdirectories or folders on the same domain, or using variants of the same, or different websites. The Importance of International SEO for eCommerce BusinessInternational SEO for eCommerce business isn't anything new. Google began ramping up its international SEO efforts back in 2006 and by 2010, geo-tagging and HREFlang tags became a multi-regional phenomenon, linking together product, currencies, and languages.
Now global SEO can connect your eCommerce business with your target audience on the other side of the world. It's also a chance to get more insight into what's working and what isn't in terms of turning your leads into sales on a much larger scale. 
Search engine optimization (SEO) is all about visibility—the more eyes on your eCommerce site, the more potential leads and sales you have. Website traffic reaches a whole new level of potential when those eyes are spread out globally and on multiple browsers.
Of course, if your eCommerce site isn't structured properly for global attention, you run the risk of missing out on a larger revenue stream.The Key Challenges of International SEOInternational SEO is certainly no easy feat. It involves plenty of challenges, including:
Language and culture adjustments
CMS and site infrastructure
Geotargeting
Choosing the right domain
Hreflang Tags
Avoiding duplicate content
Local relevancy (i.e., hosting, currency, shipping rates, etc.)
Popups and redirects
These are the most common challenges eCommerce businesses face when starting out with their international SEO efforts. Many of them can be avoided by learning what they are and how to implement each one correctly. For example, Hawk Academy by StudioHawk is an excellent resource for learning how to generate HREFlang tags, among other things.Different Ways to Roll Out Your International SEO
Once it's time for you to expand your business into the new market, you want to ensure that it's implemented correctly to achieve the best results possible. That means doing your research and understanding what's needed for a successful international SEO campaign.
Here are some things to consider when strategizing and implementing international SEO:
The Countries You Want to TargetJust because you're taking your SEO international doesn't mean you have to hit every country on the map. Starting out, it's a good idea to zero in on the countries that will have the greatest impact on your business. A good place to start looking for which country to go after is through Google Search Console and Google Analytics. This will give you a good idea of where your international traffic is coming from (if any) and where to focus your attention.Related: How to craft a rock-solid international expansion strategyTailoring Your Content for Different CountriesEven English is not a one-size-fits-all language. Between your website copy and its blog and product content, you want the language to be specific to the target location. You also want the information within the content to target the specific location.
That means doing your homework and learning about your different audiences on a cultural level as well as what they're searching for in their designated locations. Remember, you want to connect with your consumers personally, which is why localisation is key. During this stage, it’s crucial that you use Google Trends to see what keywords/terms users search in different countries. Below is an example of how Americans search for ‘quilt covers’. We can see the ‘duvet cover’ is the most accurate and relevant keyword for the United States.
Your CompetitionAny decent marketing strategy involves scoping out your competition—and exploiting their weaknesses.Of course, expanding globally means there's a lot more competition to contend with. You'll likely have competitors you never knew existed until you begin your international SEO journey. Now, your job is to find them.When you conduct your market research, you have to consider the targeted keywords in various languages and see who shows up consistently in Google.Your Domain StructureYou want your target audience to find you easily, which means you're likely going to put out double the articles and blog posts. On an international level, this requires the right domain structure.There are country code top-level domains (ccTLD) and geo-targeted top-level domains (TLD). The long and short of it is that CCTLDs will default to a specific location while TLDs can target a specific country. From there, you can also create subfolder TLD domains for more geo-targeting. Some examples of this are as follows:Subdomain: us.example.com au.example.com Subdirectory: example.com/au/[permalink here] example.com/us/[permalink here] Different website (ccTLD): example.com example.com.auPros and Cons of Each StrategySubdomains: have in the past, been demonstrated to be treated as completely separate domains, which has changed the way that people have viewed this approach as it forces you to double up on marketing activities. The pros are lower infrastructure costs for self-managed sites, as you’ll only need the one server and one domain. The main con of subdomains is that it will function as a separate entity and usually require additional resources to get all variations to rank.Subdirectories: A subdirectory is a great use case for international clients when looking to leverage the preexisting equity built up in a domain. A subdirectory is also a great way of consolidating different websites under one umbrella, avoiding any duplicate content issues and allowing international entities to decrease the amount of website properties that they manage. For example, you could create example.com/au/ for Australia and example.com/uk/ for the United Kingdom, but since they all fall under one domain you will be able to leverage the equity from the root domain when acquiring backlinks for multiple regions.  Seperate Domains (ccTLD): A ccTLD makes a lot of sense for entities operating in countries where only a singular common language is spoken (e.g. Israel, Scandinavian countries, Russia). They also make a lot of sense if they are operating within the Asian market as leading search engines such as Baidu make it very hard to rank without a .cn TLD. There is also no guarantee that Google will show the correct version (see HREFLANG in the piece to see how you can avoid this).  A downside of ccTLD’s is that having all these new domain names will mean that SEO efforts such as link building and even technical website elements will need to be split off to a different property. Running separate domains requires a lot more resources for each site to rank as they are essentially a brand new entity. There will also be a lag in results for any new domains you register when starting in a new region, as it takes time to build up the same authority as your existing domain.Either type of domain can help your eCommerce business website rank internationally—you have to choose which domain is best suited for you and your target audience. Hreflang Attributes - What You Need to KnowWhat is the hreflang attribute? hreflang is an HTML <link> markup, or <link> tag attribute, it tells the search engine which version of the page to show in search results based on the user’s browser and IP address location. It does not redirect any user to the different page variations and serves as a signal for search engines only.It looks something like this: <link rel=""alternate"" href=""https://www.airwallex.com"" hreflang=""x-default"" /> <link rel=""alternate"" href=""https://www.airwallex.com/us"" hreflang=""en-US"" /><link rel=""alternate"" href=""https://www.airwallex.com/au"" hreflang=""en-AU"" /><link rel=""alternate"" href=""https://www.airwallex.com/uk"" hreflang=""en-gb"" />A good example of an international brand that implements this correctly is Gymshark:Why is a hreflang tag so important for a website? Imagine you run an online store that sells shoes worldwide. Your site is optimised for the different audiences and has pages in various languages but doesn’t have hreflang. When someone who speaks Russian visits your website from a search engine like Google, they will see the English version and not the Russian version, including currencies in Dollars rather than Rubles, which may drive them away. Hreflang tags solve this problem - ensuring that visitors land on the page that is most appropriate to them, in this case, a website that is in Russian. Hreflang tags help you drive up your conversions and drive down the bounce rate. It will also help you rank in the appropriate region by having content optimised for the correct language, keywords and audience.Important Things to Consider When Implementing Hreflang TagsWhen implementing hreflang tags, it is essential to make sure that everything is being documented so that the rules that were initially followed when establishing best practice can continuously be rolled out or revised as new markets are released. You should always take into consideration, whenever localised sections are expanded on, pages of new localisations are published, or URLs are changed. Keeping hreflang tags updated and validated is an important factor and should be a priority. A common misconception of hreflang attribute is that it prevents Google from displaying your different pages as duplicates or spam, however that’s not true. You may have different pages for American English, British English and Australian English – the differences in each of these pages will be very minimal and thus are prone to being marked as duplicates. To overcome this problem, you can rewrite the base of the content, to make it more different. For example, using “specialization” for the US version and “specialisation” for the British version, to utilize subtle language differences. Based on our experience working with international clients, we have seen that this difference can impact the likelihood of Google using hreflang tags by up to 14%.Final Thoughts International SEO and Geo IP redirects are incredibly useful ways of rolling out internationally, but if done incorrectly can cause nightmares and substantial drops in traffic. If done right, it should help you improve your conversion rates dramatically and also lower your bounce rate. So remember when rolling out international SEO, you should keep these following things in mind (DHR): Domain - Choosing the correct domain structure for your use case Hreflang - Setting up the correct hreflang tags for your property. Redirections - Apply the correct geolocations settings and redirect options to meet your use case.Complete your International eCommerce store set up with an Airwallex Global Business AccountInternational SEO is challenging, and it takes quite a bit of effort to get it right.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/ecommerce-international-expansion-strategy,How to craft a rock-solid international expansion strategy,"BlogHow to craft a rock-solid international expansion strategy9 December 2020•8 minutesE-commerceIn this article•When Should You Start Planning for Cross-Border Expansion?•

The Two Approaches to International Expansion•How to Identify Potential New Markets•How to Nail Localisation and Optimize the Global Customer Experience•Set up the Financial Infrastructure to go Global•Time to go Global?Today we’re going to discuss a topic that most eCommerce store owners agree you should be preparing for (most aren’t) from day one:Cross-border eCommerce.When you think about cross-border eCommerce, your mind likely sees the massive opportunity. It’s hard to miss a $4.5T market that’s been on an upward trajectory for the past decade. And as an eCommerce store owner, you’re likely already selling internationally. In fact, 57% of global online shoppers make purchases from overseas retailers.Which means you may have profited from this global market without even allocating resources, laying out supporting infrastructure, and developing a go-to-market (GTM) strategy. 
The opportunity is clearly there. But the real question is: is your store up for cross-border success? Because to truly compete in this massive market you have to nail the global customer experience. And by the end of this post, you’ll know exactly what you need to do to start selling cross-border. When Should You Start Planning for Cross-Border Expansion?In our webinar on cross-border eCommerce, we asked eCommerce store owners this question:“At what stage should businesses start planning to expand and sell internationally?
Here are the responses:We couldn’t agree more with the majority vote. There’s absolutely no reason you shouldn’t be preparing for cross-border commerce from day one. Think about it - aside from the obvious upside, the barriers to entry are zero and you can dip your toes to test the market (almost) risk-free. Now, like some of our webinar attendees, you may be thinking: ”why should I prepare from day one if I’m not considering expanding cross-border?”The short answer is: because your competitors are. And even if you aren’t in a saturated, local market, the competition will inevitably saturate it. So now that it’s clear that you need to set your eCommerce store up for cross-border success, let’s explore the two approaches you need to have in mind. 

The Two Approaches to International ExpansionWithout proper planning and testing, expanding cross-border can be an expensive waste of time. You need a clear plan on how you’re going to dip your toes into the market. 1. Test First, Scale Second.The biggest mistake you can make in business is making a significant upfront investment before validating your product and understanding how your brand resonates with target customers. 
The only way to avoid this is through low-cost experimentation. You need to rigorously test,  distil key learnings, and iterate. That’s the core of a key framework outlined in the Lean Startup: Test - Learn - Iterate. At every iteration, the most valuable yield is a key learning. Lucky for us, the plethora of tools we have at our disposal have allowed for rapid testing with minimal cost. For example, you can easily test your products on marketplaces that serve your target region or country to understand what works before going all in. 
The catch here is that the only way to know if your experiment was a success is to plan and commit for long enough to collect data that will point you in the right direction. 2. Plan, Commit and Invest Enough to Get a Clear Picture of SuccessIn order for your testing to be effective, you need to commit and invest enough resources to get a comprehensive picture of success. That means you need to have your eCommerce website optimised for international channels by localising currencies, language, and the overall customer experience (we’ll come back to this in more depth). But without localising your website, you’ll have skewed data.And you need accurate data to tell you to keep doing more of what you’re doing or to stop and test something new.Once you find out what works, double-down on what you’re doing and devote 80% of your time and resources. 
To limit the time and resources you invest during testing, you need to:Set specific, tangible goals (a singular, numerical value works best) Set a short timeline to bound yourself to artificial time constraintsHow to Identify Potential New MarketsPicking the Right Next International MarketThe target region you select should be based on the data you already have, your competitors, and cultural fit. 
A great starting point in picking your target region is checking your website traffic in Google Analytics and segmenting it by top geographic locations. This will give you a good idea of where your potential customers are already visiting your store from. 
You can also do competitor research to see which geographic regions your competitors are active in. The more competitors you have active in a region, the better. It means that there’s already a market for your products. 
Lastly, you should be thinking about cultural fit and similarities between your target region and home country. The easiest cross-border move you can make is targeting countries that share the same language and are geographically close. Choosing Effective Distribution ChannelsAs we mentioned earlier, before launching a localised version of your store, consider experimenting with marketplaces. Over 60% of global online sales in 2020 took place on marketplaces, which means there’s a massive audience you can use to run tests even if you lack brand awareness. Just look at the number of people you could test your product within these marketplaces:Source: StatistaTesting your entry into a cross-border region through marketplaces greatly reduces risk, but also has two major drawbacks:Negatively impacting marginsLosing valuable customer data that you would capture on your store's website
And we’ve laid out a roadmap to testing your products on these key marketplaces in this post for Australian eCommerce store owners who want to sell on Amazon US.But marketplaces aren’t the only way to experiment with new markets. Here are 3 different expansion options:
1. Sell Globally from your Home-Country eCommerce StoreThis works well if you’re targeting a region that is geographically close and similar to yours in language and culture.  For example, if you’re an Australian eCommerce store, try targeting New Zealand. This has worked extremely well for Australian owned eCommerce business Bedhead & Hats, who successfully sell to their Kiwi neighbours. In the next section, we’ll look at how to accept multiple currencies on your store and navigate different shipping options. 2. Experiment with a Wholesale ChannelLaunching a wholesale channel might sound daunting. But it really just means selling your products through brick-and-mortar stores in your target region. It’s low risk and it’ll reveal whether other business owners believe your product resonates with an international audience. 
3. Experiment with ResellersIf your products perform well in a specific sales channel locally, consider reaching out and partnering with 3rd parties already embedded in that sales channel. For example, if you sell essential oils, you can use spas to sell your product. How to Nail Localisation and Optimize the Global Customer ExperienceSimply put, localisation is changing the experience of your eCommerce site to mirror the language and currency of the region or country you're targeting. For example, you could create multiple copies of your site tailored to your target regions. But unless you have deep pockets, this can be painful and expensive to implement. Thankfully, there are tools that can help you localize the customer experience without creating multiple websites. Customer ExperienceWhile there is a lot of overlap between User Experience (UX) and Customer Experience (CX), CX takes a holistic view of all the interactions a customer has with your brand. 

From customer service to advertising and product delivery - all of these impact your customer’s experience. I’d argue that CX is one of the most important factors that differentiate your brand from your competitors. In fact, a study by Oracle found that 86% of consumers will pay more for a better customer experience. In the context of selling cross-border, this means localising the entire customer experience. In the experimentation stage, you can offer a local customer experience by:Setting up a landing page that redirects visitors based on their countryUsing apps like the one mentioned earlier or this Geo Button app that detects a visitors region based on IP address and redirects them to the relevant storeLanguageUp to 75% of shoppers won’t consider buying from a site that isn’t in their main language. That means you need to translate every facet of your website, including things like:EmailsCreative assetsProduct descriptions Landing page content
You can imagine how much work this can be. When I was running an eCommerce store, the only way to do this was to hire a translation agency and an SEO specialist to ensure my content was optimised. Today, you can easily localise language using SEO-friendly language subdirectories to get- up-and-running quickly with apps like Localizer.Product and PromotionsAs we mentioned, all facets of your eCommerce store need to be localised. That means product descriptions, sizing charts and all related promotions & advertisements need to be translated into your target regions language. This should also include English variations for the US and the UK/Australia.You should also keep in mind that national holidays and popular shopping seasons may differ in your target region. Keep these top of mind when planning your approach.  Currency & Payment MethodsCurrency is one of the easiest elements of your website to localise because of the myriad, built-in tools available that allow you to convert currency in real-time. Your visitors should be able to view pricing in their home currency, as well as checkout and be charged in it to avoid international transaction fees.When it comes to payment methods, you should be providing all the preferred payment options that your shoppers in your target region use. It’s best to research what payment methods are most commonly used in your target region and include them in your list of options.ShippingThe most important factor to consider with shipping is the proximity of your target market to your home market. If your plan is to target similar, neighbouring geographic regions, the cost of setting up an international warehouse far outweighs international shipping costs. For experimentation purposes, the most effective thing you can do is ship internationally from your home country or outsource fulfilment to a third-party logistics company. Set up the Financial Infrastructure to go GlobalDepending on the region you’re targeting, you’ll want to be able to collect payments from your customers in their preferred currency. Unless your home-country bank offers multi-currency accounts, accepting payments and doing business in your customer's preferred currencies will be costly. Expect charges in the way of poor FX rates, coupled with international transaction fees which both easily eat into your margins.Costs aside, you also need a bank account that can integrate with key payment providers and online marketplaces. And most traditional banks are years behind in this space.You need a bank that allows you to open a global account without the time-consuming legal complications and unnecessary conversions.  Time to go Global?Expanding your business can be frustrating yet extremely rewarding. The real question here is: are you up for a challenge? If you’re in it for the long term, the answer should be a resounding yes. There’s no reason you shouldn’t be preparing your eCommerce store for international growth from day one. Get your complimentary 36-page International eCommerce Playbook to build your complete strategy.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/why-every-business-needs-user-access-management,Why every business needs user access management for purchases,"BlogWhy every business needs user access management for purchases7 December 2020•5 minutesIn this article•Why small businesses need to define their expense approval and management process
•Payment gatekeeper or empowered team access?•Steps to defining your expense approval and management workflow•Airwallex, your global business account with powerful user access management featuresAny SME owner will understand the frustrations of an ineffective expense approval process. Business growth can come hard and fast, and companies experiencing this kind of rapid growth often fail to make their expense approval process airtight.Expense approval is the process of verifying and validating payments made by your team members. It is necessary for businesses who need to delegate funds to team members in order to make timely purchases.However, the role of expense approver is often ill-defined, and the role then typically falls back onto the company accountant. Whilst this may sound fine (isn’t that an accountant's job?), a company experiencing exponential growth has to be ready to make payments in real-time, on-the-go, without waiting for one person to review and approve the payment. 
What’s more, having one person managing all company expenses leaves the enterprise open to employee expense fraud, a crime that accounts for 21% of fraud in small business.By granting specific user roles and permissions, your company will streamline the approval process and experience enhanced visibility and control over spending, an imperative for rapidly growing SMEs.
Why small businesses need to define their expense approval and management process
SMEs experiencing unprecedented growth cannot wait around to make timely purchases. For example, you may be the head web developer of a digital agency and have been tasked with hiring more developers to handle the influx of work coming in.You’ve gone through the hiring process and found two or three amazing new developers. However, your request to purchase the new team’s technology and software licenses are still pending approval with the accountant (who is tied up in a backlog of reports).When the accountant finally gets around to the expense request, they decide that the magnitude of it requires approval from the CEO, which delays the approval process even further. By this point, you have already had to ask the new team to start a week later, and this has wasted valuable company time and money.Why? Because when employees are provided access to corporate cards, the purchases add up, burying the accounts team under a mountain of receipts. Unfortunately, employees around the world are wise to this fact, and this is why employee expense fraud costs American employers alone $2.8 billion a year. Employee expense fraud is nothing more than a by-product of an outdated system, a system that can be easily rectified with an advanced accounting platform. Business owners and selected team members have the ability to delegate funds to team members when they actually need them, and this alleviates the possibility of fudged expenses slipping under the radar.Payment gatekeeper or empowered team access?There are two distinctive ways business owners choose to control their finances: with a payment gatekeeper or user access management. The benefits of user access management far outweigh those of a payment gatekeeper, as user access management empowers a team to make timely purchases with greater visibility of what has been bought. Payment gatekeeperBusiness owners may want to keep a singular payment gatekeeper. This is fine for teams of up to (say) five people, but for SMEs experiencing rapid growth, the system should be quickly discarded.
The limitations far outweigh the benefits.
Benefits:Full visibility and control of all payments for the account gatekeeper
Limitations:Slowed or bottlenecked processes at both the approval stage, and even at the payment stage after approval.Disempowered teams from making faster decisions to get what they need done, and limited visibility of payment status and timing.Strain supplier relationships when payments and invoices take too long to process.
User access managementUser access management enables a multi-level expense management process to meet the demands of a rapidly growing business. Our multi-user feature allows businesses to give access to specified funds to employees to make timely purchases either through bank transfer or a virtual debit card. The delegator can create multiple, dedicated cards with the right spend limits to make purchases in minutes, instead of days.An added benefit of providing your employees with the right access is the enhanced visibility and control both the employee and business owner. Your team can login and track their own card spend to the set spending limits. Gone are the days of shared company credit cards where business owners had to audit each line and chase up their employees on who bought what.As you will see, and as opposed to the limitations provided by payment gatekeepers, its benefits eclipse its limitations.
Benefits:Empowered teams with greater ownership of their card spend budget and better visibility on their spend and payment status.Empower team members to make timely money transfers to international suppliers.Retained control of business funds with the right access, separated approval roles and card spending limits.Faster payments without bottlenecks on senior people need to set up the payment details.
Limitations:Upfront set up cost and training for the team to learn the business account platform.Steps to defining your expense approval and management workflowA defined expense approval process makes company expenditure airtight. This occurs by taking care of the following steps:Define the right processes, policies, roles and technology for your business’s needs.Set your team up with the right training, access and employee cards needed.Enforce your expense policies so that expense claims are correctly approved or flaggedReview and adjust your processes as your business continues to growAirwallex, your global business account with powerful user access management featuresRegardless of the size of your team, Airwallex’s global business account is designed to scale with your business and streamline user roles and permissions.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/kafka-event-streaming,Kafka Event Streaming to the Rescue! Reflections from building a global FX platform,"BlogKafka Event Streaming to the Rescue! Reflections from building a global FX platform2 December 2020•7 minutesEngineeringIn this article•Background•Adoption of Apache Kafka•1. Developer Experience•2. Innovation•3. Agility•ConclusionOur engineering culture is richer for having embraced an event driven architecture in several unexpected ways.The use of event streaming improved our engineering agility whilst helping to stabilise production by providing a more observable and supportable platform. Much to our surprise Apache Kafka has helped empower innovation and enhance developer experience.BackgroundThe Airwallex foreign exchange (FX) platform recently celebrated its second birthday. Over these years, we have successfully established a distributed FX pricing and settlement capability composed of more than 60 microservices (Kotlin + Kubernetes + Kafka) which are distributed across three regions and two cloud providers.We run four self managed, cloud deployed Kafka clusters, each of which contains three brokers. Our busiest cluster comfortably handles a peak daily load which is typically in excess of 1100 events per second.On reflection, the choice to pursue event streaming as a foundation to drive our system evolution was a good one. The obvious advantages of reduced application coupling and observability — that justified the original decision — have also been complemented by some unexpected, somewhat accidental, positive discoveries.Improvements have been realised across the developer experience, platform stability as well as our groups’ engineering agility. I believe a reduction in engineering friction and support for the parallelisation of non-critical workflows has helped to foster a culture of innovation. But more on this later.Adoption of Apache KafkaThe moment of truth had arrived…
But what was the truth?
Unfortunately, we hadn’t designed our system to tell us.
Event Streaming to the Rescue!
The ‘moment of truth’ is a reference to the maiden deployment of our FX pricing application. At this point, we were yet to adopt an event streaming approach across all corners of our stack.Initially, our application was dependent on a cocktail of disparate tooling; rabbit MQ for inbound price consumption, postgres powered state management, hazelcast coordination across instances… and redis.Notably, these tools were used on the critical path for the distribution of prices across our business.Our initial services were burdened with multiple infrastructural dependencies
As a result, there was a high cost to developing against, configuring, maintaining and supporting many infrastructural dependencies.Development environments and test automation pipelines were overly burdened, and our engineers were faced with a significant technical surface area to master. In pursuit of a lighter approach, we turned to Kafka.Event streaming seemed like a natural fit within the FX domain for the movement of money across borders; a client transaction can be modelled as an ‘event’ and conveyed through a series of transformations and aggregations resulting in some physical settlement.A persistent event store seemed like a good fit for this use-case. But adopting Kafka proved to be liberating in ways we hadn’t anticipated.1. Developer ExperienceA persistent event store is very compelling. Kafka presents a powerful collection of features that support a diverse ecosystem of use-cases. With the adoption of Kafka we now had;a natural replacement for our rabbit event queuea simple alternative to our messy postgres state rehydration (via offset rewinding)convenient state sharing across components (multiple consumer groups and state stores)a partitioning scheme to support coordination and convenient horizontal scaling, without the need for hazelcast orchestration — and without a distributed lock in sight. 🎉Kafka became a universal dependency, helping to simplify our application footprint by eliminating extraneous points of failure from our critical business workflow. As such, managing a single dependency reduced burden from both unit and integration testing. It has opened the door to reusable patterns and libraries (we’d love to share more on these another day!) and also proved to be effective in helping us scale across the globe.Kafka is a jack of all trades but is also a platform that can support the mastery of a variety of different use-cases; from state sharing to horizontal scaling, event queue to replayable cache.Disclaimer; that’s not to say Kafka is always the right tool for the job! We have made more than a few mistakes over the years and I say this as the author of an expensive ‘exactly once’ event-driven RPC alternative. This proved to be less than efficient and somewhat fragile when used to service a blocking client web request.
We have learnt the hard way; a database and traditional RPC / Rest API still have their place. Where it’s suitable, on the outer edge of our platform far away from user critical API services, we still use postgres to persist (sink) our Kafka events for long term persistence.2. InnovationEvent streaming yields loose coupling. By modelling the treatment of business events as a series of independent transformations, our platform evolved into an asynchronous functional pipeline.Our platform has evolved into a functional pipeline of event transformations
Each stage of the pipeline is typically handled by a Kafka consumer/producer packaged as an independent microservice. State is carried through the pipeline in the form of events that also act as notifications to trigger subsequent stages of processing.This ‘state on the outside’ approach also leads to improved ‘pluggability’. Modelling business processes as lightweight event transformations made our FX platform inherently amenable to change.The performance and stability of our APIs has greatly benefited from our use of Kafka. API latency for our query capabilities is 1ms on average. In addition, write operations to our API have a latency equivalent to that of local Kafka ~10ms on average for a single broker acknowledgement.The reuse of events and independent offset management across multiple consumer groups, opened the door to experimentation. We have been able to trial new techniques and business workflows off the critical path in a non-destructive way.Reducing the friction associated with building new or evolving existing pipelines has ultimately helped innovation.Ideas can be trialled safely and beta versions incrementally improved and incubated until they have proved successful. Bad ideas can be unplugged and associated events left to be garbage collected by a Kafka broker.Dynamic configuration and multiplexing data replication frameworks are examples of critical application infrastructure that were first trialled, and subsequently evolved off the critical path, as lightweight event streaming accessories.Our observability and control planes have also benefited heavily from a low cost intrinsically parallel method of plugging into a common event stream.Tools like kPow, which interface directly with the Kafka broker via vanilla consumer and admin APIs, have taken our observability tooling to the next level. We can now monitor, search for, inspect, replay, and export our ‘moment of truth’ in real-time.
3. AgilityThe externalisation of application state into an event stream has opened the door to a convenient method of distributing our system across geographies.Effectively, we teleport application state between remote clusters to support parallel instances of our platform.This pattern has worked well to globally distribute our gateway API layer.State is replicated to remote clusters which power our global API distribution
Kafka topics can be replicated into multiple remote clusters concurrently, through the use of tools such as MirrorMaker.We follow a spoke-hub (or satellite / HQ) approach, where our read APIs (e.g. live pricing) are powered from state — in the form of an event stream — that fans out from our central HQ brain. In addition, our write APIs (e.g. trade capture) produce events that fan into HQ from the satellite clusters.Notably, the cost of this approach in terms of WAN latency and network distribution is effectively internalised by the mechanics of event replication. This means we can deliver fast API response times across all remote regions with insulation from cross-regional network outages.Note: the management of event replication for this use case is non-trivial and a topic that justifies a separate post.
Pluggability breeds composabilityThe capability offered by each remote region can be customised to fit the use-case for a particular geography. This is done by selecting from our menu of event transformations and API microservices which are all built against our universal event platform, Kafka.Locally, our system behaviour is composed of a symphony of micro-event operations. Globally, our capability is made up of a collection of independent platform deployments that collaborate through the medium of event replication.As Airwallex continues to scale into new markets, products and regions, we have benefitted from the agility inherent in composable event-driven architecture.ConclusionFrom opaque to observable, monolith to multiverse, coupled to composable; event streaming has dramatically impacted the way we approach engineering challenges.Developer experience has benefitted from reduced friction across test, integration and deployment phases. Loose coupling and state externalisation have supported convenient horizontal and multi-region scaling, while event reuse has opened up a low-cost channel to empower innovation.Ultimately, the use of event streaming techniques has improved our engineering agility, whilst helping to stabilise our production environment by providing a more observable and supportable platform.Our engineering culture is now richer for having embraced an event-driven architecture.Written by Alex Hilton Engineering Lead at Airwallex Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

Session 1: Craft a rock-solid international expansion strategy•Session 2: Level up your customer acquisition playbook•Session 3: Build a best-in-class global inventory and shipping system•Session 4: Scaling operations with remote teams, tools and contractors•What’s next for your eCommerce growth?eCommerce has had its biggest growth year. However, it isn’t one without its challenges. From crafting an international expansion strategy, levelling up their digital marketing, global shipping to leveraging remote contractors - we listened to our customers and decided to help.We brought together our best partners for this four-part webinar series tackling the biggest growth eCommerce challenges in 2021. For those who missed our webinar series or would like the full replay - find our key takeaways below.
Session 1: Craft a rock-solid international expansion strategyThe barriers to cross-border eCommerce have never been lower, yet it’s no easy feat to win in a new international market. In this session, Crockd’s gives us an inside look at their US expansion journey and their key learnings. Alongside our experts from Shopify, Klarna and Vend, we examine how businesses need to strike a balance between a ‘test first, scale later’ approach and an invested localisation effort to prove out a new market.Pick the right next market based on potential product-market fit and competitive market gapsCrockd's international expansion began when they saw a growing number of website traffic from the United States. The team quickly mobilised their Shopify store and shipping partners to start selling into the US while the at-home pottery market was new. With a first-mover advantage, the founders had the unique opportunity to set their brand apart from the others.De-risk your international expansion with a ‘test first, scale later’ approachPlanning an international expansion is no easy feat and often eCommerce businesses can “overengineer” their plans before validating the market demand. Shopify’s Technology Partnership lead, Jason Cormier, shares the simplest way for eCommerce stores to start experimenting with international markets with Shopify’s multi-currency feature and other integrations. Once eCommerce businesses are at scale, Jason emphasises the need to automate and streamline processes with the right apps, to effectively scale.Mikey Yasumura, Partner Enablement Manager with Vend, shares an alternative approach where eCommerce businesses leverage in-person opportunities to test products first-hand with new customers and markets.Localise your store to effectively convert and build a great brand experienceOnce eCommerce businesses have validated their product-market fit, it’s a non-negotiable to localise their digital store experience to win in the market. Robert Gibson, Klarna’s Commercial Partnerships Manager, shares how customers’ preferred way to pay varies across the US, UK and Australia that greatly impact conversion rates. Planning your international expansion strategy? Watch the replaySession 2: Level up your customer acquisition playbookEffectively reaching and converting new customers is the #1 challenges cited by eCommerce businesses, according to our pre-webinar survey. In this session, July Luggage shares their first-hand experiences pivoting their distribution, pricing and promotions strategy for their China market. Right Hook Digital, Style Arcade and Canva also demystify the role of brand and performance marketing for eCommerce businesses in 2021.
It’s a balance of both brand and performance marketing for sustained growth - constant discounts will set the wrong customer expectationsBrand and performance marketing are complementary instead of competitive to fuel sustained growth. Dee, Founder and CEO of Right Hook Digital shares examples of brands who have nailed this balance between building tomorrow’s brand while driving today’s sales. The new initial ‘10% off if you subscribe’ discount on every eCommerce store needs to be thoughtfully used to avoid attracting ‘markdown’ customers who only purchase on discount. Richard Li, Founder of July Luggage, shares his experiences in building July as a premium travel product brand without discounting his products in Australia.Localise your pricing and promotions strategy to the expectations of the marketHowever, July’s pricing and promotions strategy needed to pivot when they expanded into China. Discounting is an industry norm for China, and the team needed to build this into their base prices. Similarly, Kuo Lumpur, Global Growth Marketing Manager at Canva, localised their advertising creatives between Australia and the United States. Despite the cultural similarities, there are nuances in the expectations, humour and other factors. Kuo also noted that user-generated content is an effective and fast-growing approach to building your brand for a new audience.Use aspirational products can drive traffic, and another product set to effectively convert traffic For fashion eCommerce brands, the product selection for the advertising creatives is crucial. Michaela Wessels, Co-Founder and CEO of Style Arcade, shares the drastic difference in impressions, click-throughs and sales of an ‘aspirational’ product versus a more affordable product that is likely to convert a sale. Fashion brands have found success in better returns on their marketing dollars with their product selection across their marketing funnel.Revamp your marketing, pricing and promotionsWatch the replaySession 3: Build a best-in-class global inventory and shipping systemShipping and fulfilment underpin is key to a delightful end-to-end customer experience. Fast and low-cost delivery is no longer a nicety, but ‘table stakes’ customer expectation that impacts the final sale. Supply chain leaders from Shippit and Amazon share how consumer shipping expectations are evolving, and the available technologies for businesses deliver on that.The answer to the speed versus cost trade-off on shipping is to empower customers with choiceeCommerce businesses are facing increasing pressure to deliver faster and lower cost shipping for both domestic and international customers. William On, Joint CEO and Co-Founder of Shippit shares the key to managing this trade-off is to empower customers with the best information possible. This involves providing real-time cost and arrival quotes at check out for customers to make their best choice. eCommerce businesses should then focus their efforts on effective courier selection, which is made seamless with Shippit’s platform. Proactively managing customer expectations is key to creating a delightful shipping experienceShipping, delivery and returns are a key part of every eCommerce’s brand experience. Adam Roark, AWS’s Worldwide Leader in Transportation & Logistics, shares how proactive communications and full visibility of the customers’ shipment can build trust in your brand and prevent negative reviews. Adam also shares the rising need for a seamless returns experience as customers test out more products online instead of in-store.Build your global shipping systemWatch the replaySession 4: Scaling operations with remote teams, tools and contractorsWith any fast-growing business, your team’s capacity quickly becomes the biggest bottleneck. The crux of scaling your operations will come down to how effectively your team can adopt the right collaboration tools and leverage outsourced contractors. Hear how Google Workspace, Slack, Xero and Outsourced are seeing eCommerce businesses scale whilst remote.Workflow automation and integrations are needed to scale your team without the overheadAs your team scales, the level of coordination across teams also scales. Exponentially. Arturo Arrarte, Slack’s Head of Enterprise for APAC, shares an example from an eCommerce business that drastically reduced their customer service turnaround from 5 days to 24 hours. The team achieved this through the right integrations, automation and alerts directly into Slack from multiple platforms to streamline processes.Victor Chan, Head of G Suite Renewal & Expansion for Google Asia, shares how Google Workspace is primarily designed for their teams to effectively collaborate. Google Workspace’s vision is for a single, integrated hub for work as up to 25% of productivity is lost to context switching between tabs.Scale your operations without compromising quality or culture with remote contractorsMike Larcher, Founder and CEO of Outsourced shares the top three outsourced eCommerce roles across customer support, web development and digital marketing to meet skyrocketing eCommerce demand. Whilst outsourcing can be 60 - 80% more cost-effective than local roles, Mike emphasises that businesses need to focus on hiring high-quality talent to make offshoring effective, not just the lowest cost. Rebecca Gravestock, Director of People and Performance at Xero, also shares how crucial it is to foster trust and vulnerability to protect the company’s culture and ability to collaborate. This was a key focus for Xero as they scaled into a global team.Asynchronous communication keeps teams nimble and decisions fast With more remote teams operating across time zones and cultures, asynchronous communication is key to keeping teams informed and driving effective decisions without roadblocks. Teams no longer have to be bound to aligning calendars for a call to collaborate. Kate Morris from Adore Beauty’s virtual COVID-19 war room to collaborate with 150+ eCommerce businesses is a great example of this.
Note: This webinar replay is being finalised, we'll be sure to share this as soon as possible.What’s next for your eCommerce growth?Is your 2021 geared up for its best year yet?

There’s sometimes just… missing paperwork•Airwallex gets your payments there on time•Add up to 3% back to your margins with a business account built to go globalWaiting for funds to transfer can be frustrating. But as frustrating as they are, delayed payments are a common hiccup that comes part and parcel with running a business. And more than simply a frustration, a delayed payment can have a tangible effect. It can mean the difference between a bill getting paid on time, and a hefty fine. It can mean your staff don’t receive their wages on time. It can mean the difference between hitting your targets for that quarter or not.The direct impacts on your cashflow are obvious.So why are bank transfer times often so slow?There are a few reasons, but let’s first look at what’s actually happening during your bank to bank transfer, and the time it typically should take.
How long does it take for money to transfer between banks?There is no set or defined timeframe in which a bank transfer should occur. These days a bank transfer can take anywhere from one to ten business days.And a business day, as it’s generally understood, isn’t a vague idea. It actually has a legal definition.According to the Australian Acts Interpretation Act (1901)—yes, the Act used to interpret all other Australian Acts—in Section 2B a business day is defined as: “Any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, or public holiday”. So any day on which business would typically occur. Based on this, you can already start to see one reason why your bank transfer time feels slow, or you’re experiencing a delayed payment.So let's look at some of the more surprising reasons that have an impact on your bank transfer times, and how this can result in a delayed payment for your business.
1. Global events, like worldwide pandemicsUnsurprisingly, COVID-19 is affecting international bank-to-bank transfer times.While your bank will likely be providing regular updates as the situation evolves, most banks have advised their clients to expect delays. These can be due to limited staff, staff undergoing alternative working arrangements, or unforeseen staffing interruptions. Now this isn’t by any means a normal reason that your international bank payment is delayed, but it’s definitely something to take into account in a decidedly not normal time.
2. Bank holidays, even those in other countriesBanks work under the legal definition of business days, which means they close for public holidays and shut up shop over Christmas. So, as bank transfer times only count business days towards your transfer period, these holiday times don’t count towards this, even if you started the transfer prior to the day they’re closed.You also need to be aware of the country to which you’re sending your funds, and any holidays they may celebrate. Golden Week, for example, is celebrated in both China and Japan and is a series of public holidays contained within a one-week period. So if you transfer money to either of these countries during this time, you can expect a delayed payment.3. You transferred money over the weekend—but not your weekendIt pays to be aware of the working week in the country to which you’re transferring your funds.As per the business day rule, bank transfers made over the weekend usually won’t begin their transfer until the next business day. This is usually a Monday, but what’s considered a weekend also depends on what that country considered a working week.For example, the United Arab Emirates operate on a Sunday to Thursday working week, with their weekend over Friday and Saturday. Some Malaysian also work to this timeframe, while others operate on a more recognisable Monday to Friday.
4. Different time zones and bank cut-offsWhen making a bank transfer, the varied times are often at the mercy of any number of human factors. But you’ve also got the difference in time zones.Starting an international transfer at the end of the working day will add time to your transfer, as it’s typically sent from the next business day.For our Oceanian and Asian business partners, time zones don’t present too big a problem. But for countries with a significant time zone difference, such as Australia and the USA, this becomes a much bigger issue.For example, a payment processed at midday in Australia is the equivalent of 8:00pm in New York the day before. So when calculating business days, you need to factor in the time on the receiving end of your transfer.5. Your bank transfer is actually made via the SWIFT networkThe SWIFT network is the banking infrastructure that underpins your international transfers.Now, this network doesn’t transfer your money, per se. It transfers your information. The information of your transaction is transferred in the form of a payment order, from bank to bank, until it arrives at its desired account. These payments usually pass through a number of different intermediary banks before arriving at your destination, which is a major cause in a delayed payment.But how long a SWIFT payment takes can vary, taking anywhere from 24-48 hours, up to five business days. We’ve actually written about the SWIFT network before. Click here to read more about this legacy banking network.
6. There’s sometimes just… missing paperworkSometimes you just don’t know what’s happening on the other end of your transfer. Different countries have different money transfer regulations, tax rules, and additional documentation that needs to be filled out. China, for example, requires proof that the source of the money is legal, and it’s been legally obtained through means of income.This paperwork will be done by a human, which means — as we said above — it’s at the mercy of human error. So your transfer documentation might be all okay on your end, but in the intervening process there’s a form that isn’t filled out correctly, or it just… gets lost.We’re not saying this is an expected occurrence, but it’s still something that can occur. Missing documentation can lead to significant delays in your payments, so it’s something to factor in if time is of the essence.Related article: Best Business Bank Accounts in Australia

Replace shared corporate cards with dedicated employee cards•2. Create separate roles to create & approve payments•3. Review & reconcile expenses monthly in a scalable way•Secure your global expenses with Airwallex ExpensesBusiness owners often find it difficult to keep track of their employees’ spend. One day, a team member will use the company card to purchase an approved piece of vital software, the next, that very same team member is claiming reimbursement for a “lunch meeting” with a client you didn’t know existed. Although this can often be accidental, It’s critical to keep your business’ payment flow secure to reduce the risk of expense fraud in your growing business.Expense reimbursement fraud is defined as “any scheme in which an employee makes a claim for reimbursement of fictitious or inflated expenses” (ACFE). This could be anything from claiming pre-work coffees to intentionally changing mileage figures (of which 42% of Australians admit to doing).And while the more easygoing business owners might find these costs minuscule and allow them to go unchallenged, you might be shocked to learn that expense report fraud amounts to a global loss of $2.9 trillion each year (that’s far more than Apple’s net worth!).If you’re a business owner who is concerned about your employee spending and wants to be on top of expense control, read on to discover our best practices without the admin overhead.1. Replace shared corporate cards with dedicated employee cardsGreater visibility and control are imperative to regulating employee spend. After all, how can a company control expenses when they have a shared corporate card being passed around like a footy? Physical shared corporate cards limit the visibility of who is buying what and when. The frequency that these cards are used for “minor purchases” (or worse still, fake claims) is disheartening for accountants, as they are usually far too busy with bigger picture numbers than following up a questionable coffee order (and even if they did, how would they know which employee to follow it up with?).With corporate credit cards, multiple employee budgets are typically shared on one card. If one or more of your employees aren’t averse to being a little sneaky with their spend, there is a greater risk of blowing your budget and incurring higher debt.Enter the Airwallex virtual debit card: your ultimate expense control companion. Our debit cards allow you to delegate each employee with their own corporate card whenever they really need it. This allows you to regulate employee card access and spending without the risk they are going to blow the budget on cheeky, personal purchases.You can easily create and discard new cards to provide to your staff, granting you optimal visibility for each employee, budget and project. What’s more, each transaction is linked to your Airwallex business account, allowing you full comprehension of who spent what, where and when. So how does it work? With Airwallex’s employee cardholder feature, you can:Invite your team to Airwallex with their own login and access to track spendCreate as many dedicated cards as you need for your teamSet the appropriate daily, monthly or card spend limit to stay in budgetFreeze or cancel cards in a few clicks if the card is ever compromisedAs you can see, virtual debit cards come with a host of intelligent features which protect your business from expense report fraud.
2. Create separate roles to create & approve paymentsHaving one staff member regulating all employee spending is one of the main reasons companies fall victim to expense reimbursement fraud. First, there is limited accountability, as the one team member is tasked with regulating all company spend. This is too great a job for one person and this is where purchases slip under the accounting radar.Second, when one person is overseeing all company spend, human error can quickly come into play, with regulators making mistakes regarding contact or recipient information. Airwallex’s user access management feature allows business owners to delegate approvals to team members, so one person can book payments to suppliers, and another can review and approve the payment. For example, you might not have the time to make a particular company purchase, and so you delegate this role to a trusted team member. However, you still want the purchase to be approved by someone from accounts. You can therefore delegate a team member with the ability to create payment and beneficiary details whilst the accountant reviews and approves the payment itself.Airwallex’s user accent management feature provides the following benefits:Give your team access to Airwallex with the right permissions, so they don’t see the whole accountCreate dedicated roles that are view-only, create or approve payments and assign them to your employeesStart creating and approving payments with peace of mind
3. Review & reconcile expenses monthly in a scalable wayAs aforementioned, accountants find it difficult to follow up on employee purchases, particularly when there is no clear paper trail. With so many financial matters to think about including paying staff and budgetary requirements, it’s perfectly understandable that the occasional “client lunch” will slip under the radar.However, these misleading expenses add up and can cause a company to unnecessarily lose money, especially when the perfect expense management solution exists. Having full visibility of your business expenses in a single place is table stakes. With Airwallex, all your local or international employee expenses can be brought into the one, easily viewable location. Combining this feature with delegated purchase roles ensures you and your team have real-time visibility over transactions and business funds.With your transactions in one place, the next step is to perform an audit of your expenses. Below are common fraudulent employee expense methods to watch out for:Altering the nature of their expense Inflating the amount spentMaking multiple claims on similar amountsBuying from irregular merchantsAirwallex’s Xero integrations system allows business owners and their accounts team to sync all transactions into one place, making purchase regulation a breeze. All your accounts team has to do is set up employee cards as a bank feed and reconcile against invoices and receipts in your Xero account, it’s that easy.Secure your global expenses with Airwallex ExpensesWant an easier way to draw the line and protect your business from dubious expenses?

•What are the fees involved with corporate cards?•Luckily, there’s a low-cost alternative to corporate cards•Eliminate your foreign transaction fees with Airwallex Borderless Visa CardsWhen you run a business, making purchases and payments are inevitable. After all, as the trite saying goes, you’ve got to make money to spend money.When you’re in the early stages of your business, or if you’re a relatively small operation, using your own cash or credit card can be enough for you to rely on. If you’re diligent you can stay on top of your invoices, keep your receipts, make your payments on time, and track your spending accurately.But as your business grows, so too do your payment needs. The volume of payments you’re making will increase. There are more requirements, more levels of financial reporting required, and you can easily lose oversight of your spend.While you may have the necessary financial roles in place to manage your funds, it’s inevitable that it starts to become a much more complex process.This is where a corporate card can become a viable option for your business.

So what is a corporate card?A corporate card is a payment card, typically a credit card, that’s issued to employees of a business to use in their day-to-day role for work-related expenses. They provide an avenue for employees to make purchases and spend money on behalf of the company without having to use their own funds and get reimbursed later.Corporate cards provide businesses with a way to monitor their spending more efficiently. They can be controlled to the degree that when set up properly, they’re only available to be used for certain types of purchases. For example, travel expenses, or spending related to hosting an event.
How does a corporate card differ from a regular credit card?The spending and debt features work in the same way. But a corporate card isn’t just any old credit card. Your corporate card is opened through a bank, and you have to go to the specific banking unit that deals with their corporate card program. Visa’s corporate card service, for example, is available through all the big banks, and they provide you with the name and contact details for the specific person that deals with these cards. So it’s not your average banking service.There’s also the issue of liability. For a small business owner using your own credit card, you’re responsible for the debt incurred. For a corporate card, while the employee is using the card, the business foots the bill. This effectively protects the individual against any liability that comes with non-payment of the debt.
Does my business need a corporate card program?Whether or not you need a corporate card program will depend on the size of your business.If you’re a sole trader or a small business, then no, a corporate card program won’t be appropriate for your level of spend or income.But as you get bigger, your turnover continues to increase, and the levels of financial reporting involved in your business’ financials get deeper, then a corporate card program may become a sensible option.However, there are a few things you should be aware of before you make this decision.
Check your fees first. Depending on the number of employees in your business, the annual fee per card can quickly accumulate and outweigh the potential benefits.Foreign exchange. If you spend a lot in overseas currencies or make a high volume of purchases in foreign currencies, this can also get expensive.But more on these later.What are the benefits of corporate cards for businesses?
As well as providing credit facilities to improve your business’ cash flow, corporate cards provide your business with a number of benefits.Flexibility. A corporate card program is ideal if your staff need to make regular payments under their own initiative and you want to reduce the paperwork and red tape involved in making these payments. A corporate card empowers your staff to easily pay for business expenses themselves without the need for drawn-out sign-off procedures. It also gives them a sense of ownership over their budgets and responsibility over their spending. Improved tracking. Each corporate card has a clear payment trail, so it’s easy to track spending back to individuals. Your employees know that their spend is being monitored, so while there’s a responsibility and ownership, there’s also that knowledge that whatever they spend will be easily traced back to them. This provides a good level of protection against fraud, as you know exactly who should be using the card, and when, and any instances outside of these parameters can be identified easily. Enjoy the other benefits. Your business as a whole can enjoy the benefits associated with credit cards. This can include things like earning reward points of frequent flyer program points with your spend, or membership to particular travel clubs or to international hotel chains. These rewards can then be used back within the business to go towards future flight or travel expenses, or used as employee incentives. You can also make use of credit card bonus features like travel insurance, or emergency assistance.
Curious about virtual cards? Click here to read more about the benefits of virtual debit cards. What are the fees involved with corporate cards?In almost every corporate card program you can expect to pay an annual fee for using the service. Then, you’ll generally pay an extra annual fee per card issued to an employee. These fees vary wildly depending on the bank and the service and can be anywhere from $39 per card to almost $300 for a premium, rewards-driven corporate card service.Then there’s the interest. Corporate cards are usually credit-based or charge cards, meaning as per a regular credit card, there’s going to be interest charges if the outstanding debt isn’t paid back within the set timeframes. This interest rate can range from 12.65% to almost 18% depending on the issuing bank.On top of this, you’ve got charges for international transactions, foreign currency spend, and poor FX rates. If you’re doing a lot of business with international suppliers, these fees will very quickly add up.Luckily, there’s a low-cost alternative to corporate cardsAirwallex Borderless Cards are your alternative to the typical Visa corporate card you see around.Borderless Cards are a multi-currency virtual card, meaning there’s no physical card required. They’re free to create, and once your business account is up and running you can create cards instantly.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/transferring-money-to-international-bank-account,How to transfer money to an international bank account,"BlogHow to transfer money to an international bank account11 November 2020•5 minutesFinanceGuidesIn this article•What are wire transfers? •Efficient ways to transfer money to a foreign bank account•Are international bank transfers safe?•Why you should choose an alternative international payment provider•Transfer money to a foreign bank account in a few simple steps•Information needed for an international money transfer •Streamline and secure your international transfers•Receive transfers from a foreign bank accountIf your company operates internationally, making an international bank transfer is a quintessential part of business operations. However, with multiple options to do this, it’s not easy to understand what’s best for your business and get transparency on the fees involved, speed and features.
This is especially valid for Australian businesses. The World Bank found that the cost of sending money overseas from Australia is about 11% higher than the G20 average. This additional 11% in cost can easily eat into profit margins and can quickly affect your business’s bottom line.
We’ll walk you through the steps that your business has to take to make a fast, cost-effective and on-time international wire transfer.What are wire transfers? Historically, wire transfers refer to communications made via telegraph wires. 
To transfer funds in the past, you had to visit a telegraph office to start the payment process. Then, the telegraph office would dispatch a coded communication to a nearby office. This communication authorised the release of the funds to the recipient. 
Simply put, wire transfers are electronic funds transfers. Generally, wire transfers move money from bank to bank through networks like Fedwire Funds Service and Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Efficient ways to transfer money to a foreign bank accountDomestic business accountsMost regional business bank accounts are capable of making international payments. These international wire transfers use the global SWIFT payment network, which was created in the 1970s and has grown to include 10,000 financial institutions since its inception. There is usually a minimum transfer fee of AUD10, and the payment can take from two to five days, depending on your destination country.
In addition to this transfer fee, you will need to convert your local funds into the desired currency before sending. Contrary to popular belief, the rate that you see on Google is not the same exchange rate that domestic banks usually charge. They often charge an additional 3–5% above the interbank exchange rate, which is not always transparent when you’re booking a payment. 
It’s important to understand how these fees are charged because they will affect the final amount that the recipient receives on their end.
P2P remittance servicesPeer-to-peer (P2P) remittance has been popularised by providers like Western Union, given their significantly lower exchange rates compared to domestic banks. P2P providers make this possible by matching buyers and sellers of foreign currency to effectively transfer funds.
Because P2P providers rely on having matched funds in your chosen country and currency pair, the P2P market can influence your transfers. This can result in a different exchange rate or delays in your transfer.
Today, P2P payment apps like Paypal, Venmo and CashApp make transferring money internationally simple and doable without a traditional bank account. Are international bank transfers safe?In theory, the transference of bank-protected funds is a safe payment method. Transferring money by way of a bank transfer is a safer alternative than sending cash or a check by post. 
However, as with anything virtual, people should be prepared for the possibility of disruption from hackers. The level of security for international transactions has improved over the years in direct response to the scamming community.
Why you should choose an alternative international payment provider
With Airwallex, we are transforming the way businesses move money globally by giving you:Foreign exchange rates up to 90% better than major banks*, with no minimum amountsAccess to our global network of bank partners so your transfers arrive fast and in-fullSupport on all your international payment needs from your dedicated account managerComplete self-service with our digital platform, no paperwork or phone calls neededTransfer money to a foreign bank account in a few simple stepsYour business can transfer money to a foreign currency account with Airwallex to over 130 countries and in 18 currencies.

That’s why we’ve made it simple with ‘Contacts’. Simply choose the country you are paying to and we guide you through exactly what information you need to provide so your transfer goes smoothly. Your recipient details are saved as a contact so all future transfers can happen in a few clicks. In a nutshell, the details you need to collect of your recipient are:Recipient details: Name, address, emailRecipient bank details: Routing number, bank name, account number & BSB for Australian recipientsAdditional transfer information: Examples include proof of payment or order information for transfers when making transfers to China
Whether you need to submit SWIFT and IBAN codes or NCC and BSC numbers, you can find information specific to your country in our Payout Guide. Our Australian support team can also walk you through it all and address your questions.Streamline and secure your international transfersWhen you need to make recurring international transfers, Airwallex is built-in with powerful features to help your business manage this seamlessly.Use batch payments to send money to multiple receipts, each with a specified amount. This saves hours from creating multiple, individual payments for each contact. Batch payments are especially useful for large, recurring international transfers such as paying your overseas staff.Free up your time from making frequent international transfers by giving your accountant or team access with the right permissions. You can stay in control and secure your funds by having one team member draft the transfer, and another to approve it.Eliminate manual reconciliation of international transfers for your bookkeeping by integrating Airwallex directly to Xero. Sync your multi-currency transfers to Xero for visibility of your global cash flow in a single place.Receive transfers from a foreign bank accountOn the flip side, receiving international transfers from an overseas customer, wholesaler or supplier can also be slow and expensive. With Airwallex’s Global Accounts, you can set up local bank details for the US, UK, EU and HK in minutes. Share these local bank details with your sender to receive international transfers faster, with no transfer fees when transfers are effectively domestic transfers.For example, your customer based in the United States can make an international transfer to you with their local bank, in their local USD currency. The transfer can use the local Automated Clear House (ACH) method with $0 transfer fees, and funds arriving as fast as 1 business day.

Choosing the right online payment platform can be daunting. You need to find the one that’s best suited to your business needs, and be aware of the fees involved. So you’ve got your products ready to go. You’ve got your website up and running, and it looks good. Your customers are out there. The next step is getting your eCommerce payment gateway set up, so you can start accepting payments securely, both for you and your customers globally.It’s also worth mentioning that the payment gateway you use for domestic sales may not always be the best option when it becomes time to expand internationally. There are often additional fees and nuances when it comes to accepting payments in multiple currencies that can quickly eat into your hard-earned margins.Let’s take a look at the best payment gateways for international eCommerce, and we can help you make the decision of which one is right for your business.So, what is a payment gateway?A payment gateway is the online payment platform that enables your customers to pay you. It’s the software that captures your customers’ credit card or bank account details, then transfers this data to your bank account, securely validates their card details, and confirms that this transfer is okay to go ahead.This sounds simplistic because, in theory, it is. Your eCommerce payment gateway is the connector between you, your customer, and your bank accounts. Your payment gateway acts as an online counterpart for a physical card transaction. As there’s no physical card tapped onto an EFTPOS machine, the payment gateway facilitates this interaction for you.It’s a relationship built on trustThere’s a high degree of trust involved when choosing the best payment gateway. You need to trust that the platform has the security to safely handle the transaction. And there’s also the trust that your customers’ details are entered correctly.This trust and security are where these online payment platforms shine. They handle the payment details within a highly secure environment, reducing instances of card fraud and machine tampering. They also check the legitimacy of the users’ details at the point of sale, ensuring they’re using the right details, they are who they say they are, and they have enough funds in their accounts.The best payment gateways have built this trust over time, and their names alone are bywords for safe online banking.What to look for in a good payment gatewayThere are a few key things that will help in choosing the right eCommerce payment gateway for your business.
Low feesMuch like a financial institution, you want to ensure that your selected payment gateway isn’t charging you through the nose just to use it. So check for monthly fees, the cost per transaction, international exchange fees, and make sure you’re getting the best value for your use.Payout in multiple currenciesYou’re operating an international eCommerce business, and offering multiple currencies makes it easier for your international customers to buy from you. But this also means your payment gateway needs to accept foreign currencies too—and importantly, it needs to pay out in these currencies.Having a payment gateway that allows payout in multiple currencies means you can send and receive payment from more countries, ensuring you’re able to receive funds in that currency, which you can then in turn use to transact with suppliers and merchants in that country.Ease of implementationYou don’t want your payment gateway becoming a headache, so make sure it’s easy to set up, intuitive to use and suits your business’ needs.Look at the integrationsDoes your selected online payment platform integrate with your CMS—or your eCommerce store? Choose one that integrates seamlessly, with an API that fluidly connects with your site and allows you the flexibility you need as a growing business.Choosing your eCommerce payment gatewayLet’s take a look at some of the biggest names on the market.
AirwallexAirwallex offers a groundbreaking payment gateway solution for global businesses. With easy to use payment flows for customers across the globe, a smooth and fast checkout experience is available to businesses of all sizes. Airwallex is one of the first online payment processors that allow flexible settlement in up to 10 different major currencies, meaning customers can pay in their local currency, like USD, and you can receive and hold in USD without being forced to convert back into your home currency. This flexibility enables merchants to receive and hold in multiple currencies without being hit with exorbitant currency conversion fees while also offering the flexibility to payout in foreign currencies, or convert when the time is right.The integration methods are also incredibly flexible; businesses can integrate into their existing checkout or payment flows via an API, embedded payment fields, a simple drop-in method or a complete customer checkout journey fully hosted by Airwallex - the options are endless.

Pricing is also incredibly competitive, with fees as low as IC++ 0.6% (Interchange fee + Scheme fee + acquirer fee) 0.6% for Visa and Mastercard payments.PayPalPayPal is almost ubiquitous online. As the original payment gateway, it’s had the time and the chance to perfect its offering, so they clearly understand the pain points of both businesses and consumers. It’s got built-up brand equity that leads users to barely give it a second thought during use.Supported in over 203 countries, PayPal is a wide-reaching, flexible eCommerce payment gateway solution that integrates with most platforms.PayPal is also one of the few payment gateways that offer payouts in multiple currencies for Australian based businesses. We share how businesses are supercharging their PayPal account in this blog.But where PayPal excels in ease of use and name recognition, its big drawbacks are the fees and its speed. You can expect delays of up to 3-5 days when withdrawing funds to your bank account.For fees, you can expect to pay the following:Domestic sales: 2.6% + a fixed $0.30 feeInternational sales: 3.6% + a fixed $0.30 feeMicropayments: a flat $0.05 fixed feeCurrency conversion: 4%Withdrawing USD to a nominated USD account: 3%StripeStripe follows closely on PayPal’s heels and has the added benefit of existing in the physical realm too. It’s highly flexible and allows API access to build a custom solution, including one-click checkout. It’s quick too, with funds able to be directly deposited into your nominated bank account. The one main downside to Stripe is that it only allows you to withdraw in AUD if you have an Australian account. You can’t withdraw in USD from an AUD account, so you’re at the mercy of Stripe’s FX fees and charges. These are:Domestic sales: 1.75% + a $0.30 fixed fee International sales: 2.9% + a $0.30 fixed feeShopify PaymentsShopify Payments comes as the pre-integrated platform for Shopify sites, so by nature, it’s easy to configure and to get started. It’s designed to get your Shopify store up and running as quickly as possible.One bit of benefit is that it enables foreign currency accounts for your withdrawals, which reduces your banking fees. It also accepts a range of credit and debit cards. There are no transaction fees for Shopify users.Their fees start at:Domestic payments: 1.75% + a $0.30 fixed feeInternational payments and AMEX cards: 2.9% + a $0.30 fixed fee
SquareSquare started off as an innovative, eye-catching POS system for small businesses, and has since grown into the online payment gateway we know today. Its undeniable strength lies in its ability to connect the online and offline world, but another big plus is its adaptability. Square features native integration with WooCommerce, Wix, Magento, BigCommerce, and more. And while your money is typically delivered the next day, one drawback is that you can only withdraw in AUD.Square’s fees vary depending on the type of transaction you make, so you can expect to pay from 1.9%—2.2% per transaction. But on the plus side, it comes with the cool POS system we’ve grown to love.
Choosing the right payment gateway depends on your eCommerce business’ needsChoosing the best payment gateway for your business will largely be driven by your website’s CMS, and which platform natively integrates into it. If you’ve got the know-how and the budget, we recommend opting for an international payment platform that can integrate using API, as this provides a much smoother experience.And as a business looking to grow your international customer base, you should choose a flexible platform that allows you to settle in multiple currencies.But keep an eye on their fees. These start to build up, and can easily eat away at your profit margin.

What’s ahead for Kat The LabelKate Nixon was a fashion graduate living in Byron Bay when she began experimenting with delicate lace. 
It was 2015, and Nixon was looking for ways she could take her talent to the fashion market. She began intertwining the lace with details, fashion and lingerie, creating the stunning designs that would become synonymous with Kat the Label. Seeing a gap on Instagram for women’s lingerie, Nixon began posting her designs on the platform. Soon, buyers from across the world were approaching  Nixon for one of her elegant pieces.Today, Kat the Label operates in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with over 80,000 Instagram followers eager to purchase one of the label’s fiercely feminine designs.
Find out how Nixon entered the US fashion market using automation, influencers and localisation. Persistence is key to unlock the US fashion market
Nixon saw a clear profit margin opportunity for Australian businesses selling to a significantly larger US audience in USD. This is an amazing opportunity for business owners looking to increase their margins and will require effective localisation to succeed in their international expansion.
The first step Nixon took to step into the US market was to build the right wholesaler relationships. This process took persistence and patience, as it was over a year of nurturing before Nixon caught her big break.
‘I had a wholesale rep who had amazing store contacts like Revolve who wanted to represent Kat the Label. We’d emailed them for months and shared samples with little response,’ Nixon says. ‘On the final day of my trip in Los Angeles, I emailed Revolve saying that I was in town and asking if they wanted to catch up. Their buyer responded and agreed to meet up - I was flying out that night so I literally took my suitcase to their head office. We met and nurtured the relationship from there.’
Kat The Label’s established Australian brand built confidence in both Nixon and her retailers that their beloved product would succeed in the US. Nixon advises fashion labels to build a strong local brand first before pursuing international expansion for this reason.
Localisation is a ‘make or break’ for fashion companies
Localising Kat the Label’s website for the US has been imperative to making inroads in the country. Nixon split the Kat The Label website for their Australian and US customers. This creates a better customer experience and drives stronger conversion rates.
This dedicated Shopify website for her US audience allowed her to localise:Currency and pricing to match the US marketShipping options and timingProduct specifications such as sizes and measurementsProduct images with local iconic scenes and modelsSeasonal promotions with the different seasons between Australian and the USRe-marketing for US customers with relevant offers
Once she had her US launch date, Nixon invested in marketing her brand in the US with Los Angeles-based photoshoots: the local scene, local models and local photographers. Nixon says this is important as US customers can be specific about a brand’s image. ‘It helps create this awesome native content like what we had for our website.’
The right influencers can fast track upcoming fashion brands in a new marketToday, Kat the Label has hundreds of passionate influencers ready to promote its products, and Nixon says this is due to carefully selecting each influencer before sending out gifts. ‘You need to check out their page and avoid influencers who might be in it for the freebies, like teeth whitening kits and protein shakes,’ Nixon says. ‘We gift the fashion influencers that genuinely believe in the products they endorse and have an engaged following that we’re wanting to reach.’Nixon stresses that an influencer will create higher quality content if they are genuinely interested in your brand. Finally, you have to know that the influencers promote your product in a manner that is brand-suitable, as you may accidentally de-value your brand with unsuitable content towards the wrong demographic.
Invest in the right partners and apps to enable international scale while keeping operations lean Despite Kat the Label’s small team (just Nixon until 2020 and now her operations coordinator), the brand is flourishing due to Nixon’s savvy investment in the right people and apps. 
'Initially, I was hesitant about paying for agencies or apps. I wasn’t sure if I would make my money back. However, it’s clear now that these are essential investments to grow the brand and have more than returned its cost.’ Nixon says.
Kat The Label partners with Kate Collinson, an eCommerce consultant who specialises in re-platforming and growth marketing for the Shopify & Shopify Plus platform. In early 2020, Collinson, a longtime fan of the brand, built a business case to relaunch their two Shopify stores to improve the mobile experience. Now, she is now helping spearhead online growth through focuses on online advertising and customer lifecycle marketing. 
The team saw enormous growth of over 50,000 email subscribers and revenue by migrating from Mailchimp to the more advanced eCommerce platform Klaviyo that could segment US and Australian audiences.
‘We also incorporated the “Back in Stock” Shopify app which made it easy to notify customers once a particular product is back. This was an easy and automated way to drive sales and not lose potential leads.’
Streamline international payments with Airwallex
Airwallex was another recommendation by Collinson who saw the opportunity to eliminate expensive and unnecessary foreign exchange fees. Nixon was losing money on every international transfer from her retailers and suppliers with her previous payments provider.
Now, Nixon uses Airwallex's international payments to pay her team in the US, suppliers in China and SaaS subscriptions in USD. This has simplified her international payments with faster, on-time payments with minimal fees.  
What’s ahead for Kat The LabelKat the Label is now looking to expand its in-house team and make moves into the European market. This provides Nixon with exciting new business challenges. ‘We just need to figure out the logistics of getting stock from Australia to Europe - there’s quite a lot of barriers we are working out.’
‘We are seeing a rise in orders to Europe,  from the Netherlands, France and Italy, so I think this  will be the next step overseas - it’s really exciting.’Are you looking to take your fashion label global but not sure how?

You don’t need to outlay a lot of capital for stock•What are the disadvantages of dropshipping?•Is dropshipping the right avenue for your business?•It can be a proving ground for established businesses•
Emerging businesses can benefit from dropshipping, too•Our final thoughtsWhether you’re a hustling e-commerce entrepreneur that’s just starting out, or you’re a bustling business that’s consistently turning over six figures, you’re always looking for the next avenue in your e-commerce strategy.You’ve likely heard of dropshipping at some point in time, but what is it exactly?In this article we’ll discuss what dropshipping is, how it differs from traditional e-commerce, and whether or not it’s right for your business.What is dropshipping?Dropshipping is a method of order fulfilment where, instead of stocking a physical product yourself, you’re essentially acting as the middleman between the producer and the customer. How dropshipping worksSay you set up an online store selling novelty socks. Traditionally you would source all the different designs and colours of socks yourself. You’d buy them in bulk, and have them delivered to a storage space. From here, you would take orders from your customers, then pack and post the orders yourself.With dropshipping, the process is truncated. Instead, you set up your online store and then source a supplier that sells the socks you want. Your customer then buys the socks from your site, you pass the sale on to the supplier, and they pack and ship the product to the customer on your behalf.Dropshipping is effectively a hands-off process for connecting customers with products, that eliminates the need for you to deal with storage and fulfilment.Before you get started, you're going to need a business account. Click here to read our guide on how to open a business bank account in Australia.What are the advantages of dropshipping?It’s easy to get startedAs a dropshipper, you don’t need an office or warehouse to get up and running. All you need is an online store from which to sell your products and a connection to a business that supplies your stock, and you’re ready to go.
You don’t need to outlay a lot of capital for stockYou’re not putting money down to gather the materials to make your products. In fact, there’s absolutely no labour on your part. You can get started with limited funds, with the only costs being for the online portion of your business. You don’t need to spend piles of money buying stock that you’re only 70% sure will sell, meaning less risk, and a lower barrier to getting started.It’s easy to manageYou’re not dealing with storage and fulfilment yourself, so all you need to manage is running your shop, and your suppliers.It’s endlessly flexibleYou can pivot to selling different products as quickly as you can find the supplier. You’re in control of your business, so you set the prices, choose your products, and fine-tune your sales strategies as you go.What are the disadvantages of dropshipping?Low product marginsWhen it comes to dropshipping, most of the money you earn goes directly back to the supplier. All you’re earning is a small percentage off the top. So to make money in dropshipping, it’s all about choosing the right product and the right supplier. And you’re got to be wary: margins for some products are quite low, so you’ll need to sell a high volume in order to make it worth it. This can be particularly risky when selling in competitive product niches.Need help working out your break-even point? Check out our break-even analysis tool to download your free copy.Increasing your margins is where Airwallex can help out dropshipping businesses. When you open an account with Airwallex, you’ll never pay any banking fees—ever. With competitive FX rates (up to 90% cheaper than the big banks), and the ability to bank in 11 different currencies, you’ll be able to save money you’d otherwise spend on foreign transfer and exchange costs. And these cost-saving methods, while seemingly obvious, help to reduce what little overheads you have and go a long way to increasing your profit margins.
It’s a more complex shipping processAs you’re not the one shipping your products, you can’t control what happens during the shipping process. You’re effectively at the mercy of your supplier. They may have a number of different shipping solutions they use, which means shipping prices and times vary considerably depending on the product and location. Selling different products from a range of suppliers means that a single customer order can be made through multiple warehouses, so your customer receives each product at different times.There’s a marked loss of controlDropshipping means that you only control one portion of the pipeline. If anything goes wrong on the supply side, this can be difficult to manage on your end. So you have to have faith in your suppliers. But no matter how much you trust them, things can still go wrong. You don’t have oversight of your warehouse, so you can’t be 100% sure exactly what’s in stock. And whether it’s shipping the wrong item, an item getting damaged in transit, or the product never showing up at all, these errors are out of your hands. Building a good relationship with your suppliers and keeping your lines of communication open is critical to mitigating any supplier errors.Is dropshipping the right avenue for your business?We’ll be honest: we can’t definitively answer this for you. Because whether or not dropshipping is right for your business depends on what you want to achieve.It’s ideal for starting outYou’ve got low initial overheads, so all you really need is an online storefront and the right supplier. Then it’s all about how you market your products, where, and to whom.So if you’re looking to pivot, launch with a low budget, and have identified a good niche and some good suppliers, then dropshipping is a good choice.It can be a proving ground for established businessesFor businesses with the capital to invest in custom products and purchase in advance, dropshipping allows you to improve their margins, supply chain, and brand experience.One of the huge benefits of dropshipping is that it can almost be run like a side hustle. For your established business, you can set up lines of dropship products as a way to test the market, to offer new products, and as an extra source of revenue. Then, if it proves profitable, you can bring these products in-house, and reap the rewards of the groundwork already done for you.
Emerging businesses can benefit from dropshipping, tooDropshipping is a good starting point for emerging businesses aiming to grow into the traditional e-commerce model when they have the capital.Think of it like your business’ training wheels. You’re learning the ropes of e-commerce, learning what works and what doesn’t, and building a client base. You’re understanding how to market, how to position your business, and using dropshipping as a vehicle to achieve this. Our final thoughtsWith its low barrier to entry, and endless flexibility, dropshipping is a fantastic way to enter the market.But remember—it’s competitive. Low margins, loss of control, and being at the whim of your supplier are all things you need to factor into your decision to dive into the world of dropshipping.Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-matter-is-revolutionising-the-traditional-agency-model,How Matter is revolutionising the traditional agency model,"BlogHow Matter is revolutionising the traditional agency model14 October 2020•5 minutesCustomer storiesE-commerceIn this article•Digital retail needs are evolving, and so are the client expectations on agencies•Matter reinvents the digital agency value propositionMatter Design & Digital (Matter) delivers end-to-end Digital Commerce solutions that span from branding, BigCommerce shops to omnichannel fulfilment solutions. Their notable recent clients include Gillette, Wittner Shoes, The Upside, Tradelink and Pillow Talk.
 We sat down with Nigel Poole, Director of Matter to understand how Matter is evolving to continue to win, retain and grow with clients. 
Digital retail needs are evolving, and so are the client expectations on agenciesJust delivering multi-region eCommerce shops was no longer enough
Multi-currency and localised websites are now table stakes for any digital agency. It was no longer enough for Matter to stand out and win clients. They needed to offer a truly differentiated service that helps their clients stay a step ahead of their competitors.

“Our clients needed supporting systems to know how they will fulfil the demand from their eCommerce stores, alongside their physical store network. They wanted to automate this all the way through to their ERP and accounting systems.”
Shift away from projects, towards a value-based partnership model 
Matter found their clients were not just looking for project delivery but wanted ongoing access to high-performing digital talent and teams. It is incredibly difficult for clients to build this capability in-house. However, Nigel and his leadership team have invested deeply in their team and culture to enable his teams to be high-performing.
“Clients are looking for a long-term partner, not just an agency delivering a project. They want someone who can go on a growth journey with them.”
Matter reinvents the digital agency value propositionEnd-to-end Digital Commerce solution from branding through to international payments“We’re constantly innovating on our projects to find new ways to help our clients. Our services are unique because of this. We help our clients build Digital Commerce systems that span from the store, the CRM, omnichannel fulfilment to global payments with Airwallex.”

Matter is about delivering tangible value for their clients, beyond just the eCommerce store. Partnering with Airwallex gave the team and their clients a better way of managing their money globally that previously was not possible.
“Businesses have systems to manage their inventory, we see Airwallex as the system to manage their money. Airwallex is now part of our strategy to optimise our clients’ global purchasing and payments. It is something that any modern agency will naturally be recommending as part of the usual technology stack.”Airwallex’s no monthly fee model made it easy for their clients to say yes to, in contrast to other software subscriptions. Matter now had a simple, but powerful foreign currency account solution that was also easy to set up and could deliver benefits in days, instead of weeks.

Matter demonstrates its own commitment to innovation by using Airwallex for their own team expenses and global payments. Having employee cards has saved hours for Nigel and his team. Airwallex empowers the right people to make needed purchases quickly, without the approval bottlenecks.

“We’re excited to use Airwallex as part of our day-to-day way of doing business.”
Value-based partnership model for on-demand access to high performing teams and digital talent“The role of the digital agency is transforming from just delivering projects, to proactively providing strategic advice for our clients on better ways of working. We have won deals because we take a more personal approach. Our clients want to partner with high-performing teams, rather than just an agency to deliver a project,”

Matter has won over clients with their value-based partnership approach, dedicated client success teams and investment in high-performing teams. Their value-based approach to partnerships means no lock-in contracts, reinforcing the idea of a mutual partnership with their clients.
 Their team has also expanded to include strategic thinkers. People who can deeply understand how the business operates, lead strategic conversations outside of the scope of an eCommerce website and identify valuable opportunities for clients.



“Our goal is to be indispensable to our clients. We do that by creating good value on an ongoing basis. We don’t lock our clients into long-term contracts. This keeps us on our toes to deliver value, and allows our clients to stay in control of the partnership.”
Building global market knowledge through international projects “We’ve been actively doing projects in the US and other markets as part of our strategy to expose ourselves first-hand to new learnings, concepts and markets,” said Nigel.
As Matter builds out their international experience and footprint, Airwallex continues to be the team’s choice to transform the way clients move and manage money globally.Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/ecommerce-key-performance-indicators,Key performance indicators for emerging e-commerce businesses,"BlogKey performance indicators for emerging e-commerce businesses9 October 2020•5 minutesE-commerceIn this article•What is a key performance indicator?•Why are key performance indicators important?•Key Performance Indicators for Marketing•Key Performance Indicators for Sales•Improving sales margins KPIs with Airwallex•Key Performance Indicators for Customer Service •Set your business on the right course, with the right KPIsWhen you think of key performance indicators, your mind probably goes straight to massive international companies that deal in finance, mining, or real estate.But it’s not just multinational juggernauts who should be focusing on setting and reaching KPIs. As an e-commerce business, setting the right KPIs allows you to create targeted goals to work towards, which enable you to steer your business in the right direction.In this article, we’ll discuss what KPIs actually are, why they’re important for your business, and give you some examples of KPIs that e-commerce businesses should be aiming towards.What is a key performance indicator?A key performance indicator, or KPI is a specific measurement against which your critical business performance is tracked. It’s a quantifiable measurement used to gauge your business’ progress—the figures that must be met to achieve success with your business.For e-commerce businesses this may be in terms of units sold, income earned, customer numbers, customer satisfaction scores, web traffic, or similar.
This is where KPIs can get misunderstood. It’s not just about tracking sales figures, the volume of stock moved,or even goals like improving customer retention. KPIs are all about setting clear targets to hit, that if you don’t hit them, it’s an indicator of areas that need to be improved in your business.Why are key performance indicators important?KPIs help your business set clear, measurable targets that can be used as goals against which to track your business’ progress and measure its performance. They’re used as a way to track, monitor, and measure your business’ success over time.Every business is different, so these KPIs should be selected based on your business’ unique goals. So to set clear KPIs, you need to determine the goals that are going to move your business forward.Broad, vague phrases like ‘increase sales’ or ‘boost customer retention’ aren’t KPIs—they’re goals, or outcomes to achieve. Necessary goals, yes, but these don’t quite have the business-critical aspect that true KPIs should possess.KPIs help analyse your businessWhen set correctly, your KPIs can provide good data that you can use to monitor your business’ progress. Success against your KPIs allows you to refine them over time, and develop strategies to better hit those KPIs for the future.Important KPIs for e-commerce businessesThe options for setting KPIs for e-commerce businesses are practically endless, so there’s plenty of scope to build solid business targets. The most important thing is to pick markers that make sense for your business.We’ve pulled together a broad list of important KPIs that you can consider for your e-commerce business, split across the areas of Marketing, Sales, and Customer Service.Key Performance Indicators for MarketingWhile marketing isn’t an end goal, it’s an important tool that helps get customers onto your site in the first place and buying your products.Website traffic: Measures how many potential customers arrive at your online store. Web traffic is a good measurement to check how effective your marketing channel mix is, and a channel breakdown is the best way to see what is working, or what isn’t.Bounce rate: The number of users that leave your site after not taking any action or viewing any other pages. This is critical as it can identify issues in load speed, content quality or targeting effectiveness.Traffic source: Determine where your customers are coming from. This metric tells you about your customer journey and enables you to see which of your marketing channels are most effective.Pages per session: The average number of pages your customers visit while on your site. A high pages per session is an indicator of engagement and means your audience is engaging well with your site. Average time on site: The average length of time users spend on your site. This can indicate your customers are finding your site really engaging, or, alternatively,  are having difficulty finding what they’re after. Combine this with other metrics like bounce rate to paint a clearer picture.Key Performance Indicators for SalesAs an e-commerce business, your success is built on your sales, so it’s important to work towards the right goals. Sales: A measurement of your total sales. This can be broken up by product, or for particular time frames like days, months, quarters, of for the entire year.Contribution margin: Determine the average profit margin of your products to reach a percentage figure that demonstrates how profitable your products are. Your profit margin is the difference between your revenue, and the total costs of the products you sell.Cost of goods sold: The amount of money you’re spending per product that you sell. Shopping cart abandonment rate. As consumers, we’ve all been there. You’re shopping online, but the order doesn’t go further than your cart. Cart abandonment can happen for any number of reasons, but it’s a crucial one to keep track of, as it can indicate a big problem in your customer journey.Customer acquisition cost. How much you spend on acquiring new customers, typically involving marketing expenses. To work this out, divide the total cost you spend on acquiring new customers by the number of customers you acquire.Customer lifetime value. Recurring customers are usually more valuable to businesses than acquiring new ones. Customer lifetime value refers to the monetary value these customers deliver throughout their relationship with your business.Improving sales margins KPIs with AirwallexOpening an Airwallex account allows you to transact fee-free, so you’re able to reduce your cost of goods sold by driving down unnecessary overheads like transaction fees. Our Global Accounts let you transact in 11 different currencies, so you save money on foreign transfer costs when paying suppliers and overseas staff. And, with competitive FX rates up to 90% cheaper than the big banks, you also save any time you exchange currency. All these little wins add up to big savings, and help you improve your profit margins for the long term.Key Performance Indicators for Customer Service While sales are a big part of your business, it’s important to track your business’ progress against customer service goals. After all, loyal customers help build your business through repeat sales and becoming advocates of your brand.Net promoter score (NPS): NPS is a world-recognised metric that measures the loyalty of a customer to your business in easy-to-understand terms. Your customers rate your business on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means they’re actively detracting from your business, and 10 indicates they’re actively promoting your business to friends and familyAverage first response time: The average time it takes you to respond to a customer’s first query from your business. To be seen as a responsive business, it’s good to keep this figure as low as possible.Average time to resolution: The average time it takes from the moment the customer contacted you, to the instant their query is resolved. Third-party reviews/star rating: Reviews, whether as testimonials or in a star-format, act as social proof that people value your business and your products. These work to demonstrate customer loyalty, measure customer satisfaction, and are also useful for marketing and SEO purposes. Set your business on the right course, with the right KPIsThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but it will give you a good idea of what to plan for when developing your own KPIs and e-commerce business strategies.Remember, setting the right KPIs gives your business meaningful goals and targets to reach—so be sure to create KPIs that are steering your business in the right direction.Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs

The more accurate data you gather for forecasting, the better prepared you’ll be the same time next year, and the more efficient your stock control methods will be.You’ll reduce wastageUnsold stock sits in your storage space, taking up room that could be used for new stock, tying up your business’ capital until it gets sold. It sits there, costing you money that you’re not making back. And if it never gets sold, it just turns into a waste of money and eventually a loss.Efficient stock control methods allow you to use your historic data to determine exactly how much stock you need to order, and when. Which means no more over-ordering. You’ll reduce the amount of storage space going to waste and stop losing money on stock that ultimately never sells.It helps improve your cashflowThe right inventory management techniques enable you to manage your cashflow in a much more efficient manner. Think about it this way, your stock is a collection of assets that your business has purchased. They sit in storage until they’re sold. So if you’re not selling them, or you don’t have enough to sell, then you’re effectively losing money, causing a gap in your cashflow.Managing your stock efficiently means you have the right volume of stock leaving and entering your business, smoothly rotating across your shelves (metaphorically or otherwise). You’ll be able to manage how much you’re spending on re-ordering, maximise your storage costs, and you’ll be able to make calculated forecasts on your income.When it comes to keeping your financials in check, Airwallex is the business account of choice for Aussie e-commerce businesses. With the ability to make same-day payments to your suppliers and logistic providers in multiple currencies, without excessive fees or hidden exchange rates, we’ll help you manage the financial side of things.There will be no gaps in your income, no unexpected new stock costs or bills to pay; your business will run like a well-oiled machine.It helps you provide a better customer experienceEmploying good inventory management techniques means you’ll always have the right amount of stock available. You’ll always know what you have, and how much, so you can easily answer any customer questions, and they won’t have to worry about waiting for new stock to arrive. You’ll be able to run your business efficiently, meet customer demand, ship your products quickly, and keep your customers coming back.Our stock control tips for better inventory managementAs your business grows, employing the right stock control methods can make all the difference between a smooth, efficient business, and operating in an environment of barely-controlled chaos.Here are our top stock control methods you can employ as an e-commerce business to tighten up your cashflow, reduce your wastage, and streamline your business. 
#1: Know your minimum stock levelsKnowing and understanding your stock levels is one thing—but knowing your minimum levels of stock is where you’ll really be able to take control. By understanding the minimum amount of stock you always need on hand you’ll be able to easily tell when it’s time to re-order more. By having a clear minimum volume, you can put processes in place to re-order more stock when this number is reached. It helps you automate your ordering process, so you never run out of stock, and you can take one more thing off your plate.
#2: Optimise your storage processesFor any e-commerce businesses, good warehouse management makes your operations run smoothly. This extends down to how you store your products.  Whatever sized storage space you have, make your stock easy to get to; don’t pack smaller items below or behind larger items where they’re harder to reach. When receiving new stock, don’t just shove more products into your warehouse; pack them neatly.It’s always wise to operate under a First In First Out basis: older stock gets sold first, to make way for new goods. This ensures your products don’t sit around gathering dust, being crushed under larger packages, and you won’t be stuck selling out-of-date products.Efficient storage management makes the fulfilment process that much easier.
#3: Crunch the numbersAs a business owner, don’t be afraid to really dig into your sales and stock data, and get nerdy with it. Find out what’s selling, what’s not, and look at the numbers around these numbers.Analysing how fast certain stock moves allows you to determine where different sales tactics can be used. Some items may need to be discounted, some might be sold as bundle deals.So crunch the numbers, dig into your data, and learn what makes your business tick. This empowers you to make smarter choices in your ordering and storage, and lets you generate more accurate data for your forecasting.
#4: Audit your stock regularlyRegular checks of your inventory lets you have a firmer grasp on your business. By regularly auditing your stock, you’ll ensure you’re receiving the right volumes and the right products.A few missed pieces here or there, one or two defective products, these costs add up. They can put your numbers out, deliver incorrect reporting data, and even make you lose customers.Performing regular audits of your stock and spot checks of your inventory, ensures you see with your own eyes that your business is running smoothly.And when reconciling your stock volumes against your orders, good inventory management software is invaluable.#5: Have a good stock management system in placeBusinesses grow. Where you started off by using a simple Excel spreadsheet to track and monitor your stock—it may have even been a notepad and pen—you’ve likely now outgrown this method.Spending the money and investing in a good inventory control database ensures you can quickly and easily manage all your incoming and outgoing stock, and always know what you’ve got available.Inventory management software is pretty clever these days. You can set up low stock alerts, automate customer returns, and even your re-ordering. And with the rise of cloud computing, you can access your stock management software from anywhere in the world, allowing you to maintain efficiency wherever you are.Two leading eCommerce inventory management platforms for Australian e-commerce businesses are Dear Inventory and Neto. Both provide powerful cloud-based features such as automated forecasting, ordering and dashboards to help you master inventory management.#6: Be good to your suppliers, and they’ll be good to youBusinesses are built on relationships, and maintaining positive working relationships with your suppliers is critical to managing your stock.Now, this doesn’t mean you have to be best friends with them—it just means being communicative, clear, timely, respectful, and reasonably friendly. Pay your invoices on time. Always give a heads-up if your stock levels are likely to change. And treat your suppliers with basic human respect. By building this goodwill, they’ll, in turn, be more likely to help you out in a tight spot, and keep your business running smoothly.Running a tight ship starts with how you manage your stockBy taking note of these inventory management techniques, and actively using them in your business, you’ll be able to create a more efficient, more streamlined e-commerce business.With your stock management in control, you can focus more on the future, and the exciting growth your business has in store.Related article: How to Price and Promote your Product for International MarketsBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/clipchamp-how-an-attempted-supercomputer-became-a-global-content-creator,Clipchamp: how an attempted supercomputer became a global content creator,"BlogClipchamp: how an attempted supercomputer became a global content creator30 September 2020•4 minutesCustomer storiesClipchamp’s mission is simple: help everyone to become a creator of awesome video content. Within the last year, Clipchamp has rapidly gained a global following, with 11 million users from the US, Brazil, India, Russia, and all beginning here in Australia. Clipchamp turned to Airwallex for a business account that could keep up with their global growth.Clipchamp offers a comprehensive video editing, recording, compression and conversion platform, with rapid global growth of 11 million users and counting. We sat down with Clipchamp's co-founder, Tobias Raub and financial controller, Tristan Cheal to find out more.Clipchamp provides video creators with a seamless production process
In 2014, Clipchamp founders Alex Dreiling, Soeren Balko, David Hewitt and Tobias Raub had a goal: to build the world’s largest distributed supercomputer. 
They soon realised that their goal was, somewhat, unattainable, but in the process found another use case: digital video processing technology. They wanted to develop technology that provided a streamlined user creation experience.
The founders saw an opportunity to create the world’s first in-browser video editing platform. “They come to Clipchamp with the goal to build a video, and we give them the tools to do that,” said Tobias.

Explosive growth within the last yearClipchamp’s accessible and simple tool has launched them to become one of the world’s fastest-growing video creation tools. Globally popular for the creation of social media, educational content, onboarding and more, Clipchamp had an eye for going global from the beginning.
“Going global happened quite early on with our product. Since it was digital and online, it lends itself to new markets easily. We would have missed a giant opportunity had we not expanded as early on as possible, especially since the Australian market is relatively small compared to other countries.” said Tobias
Localising a global digital productClipchamp has enjoyed explosive growth in the last year and has seen their staff triple in size to keep up with their 11 million registered users. This global expansion required the team to craft a seamless, local user experience beyond just their Western markets.
“Our roadmap is to localise the experience - not just language, but also localising the payment experience and video templates we offer. This is different from market to market.”
A global business account that could scale with the teamAlongside Clipchamp’s growth in revenues and teams, they needed a better way to manage payments, thus turning to Airwallex. Clipchamp found that the financial accessibility of Airwallex’s platform made them more flexible than traditional providers.
“With our old provider, banking access was limited to the CEO. With Airwallex, however, I could easily create multi-user access. I could set up roles and add users, as well as the bank accounts and debit cards.” said Tristan
In addition, 95% of Clipchamp’s revenue is in USD, being the currency charged to all customers outside of Australia. Clipchamp wanted to collect this revenue and pay subscriptions and other expenses seamlessly, without the fees that major banks charge. Airwallex’s US global accounts and multi-currency cards made this possible. 
“Being able to set up a domestic account from anywhere is awesome, as well as being insured and having the same protection a US bank account would have. It gave me great confidence to know that accounts are held in trust in our name.”
Going global, however, is not without its challenges. International markets contain their own tax and privacy regulations that the team needed to get right for successful expansion.
The US market remains the hotbed for technology partnerships, talent and fundingClipchamp understood that to compete on a global scale, they needed to build a strong US presence, especially when investors, technology partners and quality talent remain important accelerants for a SaaS business.
“While other regions have caught up in recent years, the US is still light years ahead for venture capital and seed funding. If you want to do a serious round and compete globally, you need to be able to compete in this market,” said Tobias
Clipchamp knew having the right partnerships with other leading SaaS platforms could ‘make or break’ their product. In 2019, they joined the epicentre of innovation and began building their US presence.
“Since we established our US presence, we have had household names who have reached out and want to partner with us. Having the right integrations could totally change the trajectory of a technology business. So you need to be where the people you integrate with are.”
What’s in store for Clipchamp?
“We’re working on a number of exciting additions to our video creation platform and are building additional features to cater to international markets. A recent product launch we’re excited for is an AI voice-over generator for English. We’re working to make this available in other languages and bring it to our whole customer base,” said Tobias.
One of the founders’ more difficult challenges right now lies in managing a growing, global team. “We have more people starting in different locations as the team size increases. This means that many haven’t met their workmates in person yet, and it’s important to have that personal touch.”
With so much excitement surrounding Clipchamp, we can’t wait to see Australia’s next unicorn.Related article: Rotor One is Flying High Over Melbourne

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/hawkeye-vintage-how-a-melbourne-pop-up-shop-became-a-global-fashion-mainstay,Hawkeye Vintage: how a Melbourne pop-up shop became a global fashion mainstay,"BlogHawkeye Vintage: how a Melbourne pop-up shop became a global fashion mainstay24 September 2020•4 minutesCustomer storiesDanielle Goodwin came to Melbourne with a mission: taking her extraordinary vintage collection to the world. Today, Hawkeye Vintage is a luxe fashion leader, with buyers from across the world eager to get their hands on one of its rare and exquisite pieces. The pop-up shop with its name in Melbourne fashion folklore
It was 2011, and Danielle Goodwin had just returned to Melbourne after assembling an otherworldly vintage goods collection in Japan. The collection, containing one-off pieces from the likes of Gucci, Hermès and Louis Vitton, was originally kept in storage, its wondrous designs hidden from the adoring fashion world.
Goodwin knew that she couldn’t allow such desirable pieces to be kept in storage, and so hosted her first Hawkeye Vintage pop-up shop on Melbourne’s famed Greville Street. 
The response was overwhelmingly positive, with the appointment-only store selling out of pieces in just two months. Replenished and always revitalised, Hawkeye Vintage has made the COVID-era digital switch, and has seen incredible results in the process. 
A global vision from a fashion capital
Goodwin originally set out with a global vision, but decided to grow her business out of Melbourne.
“I decided to scale it down and grow in Melbourne, and then across Australia and New Zealand. A lot of things happen by surprise, and as we’re going, I am always adding things for our business to grow bigger as well as taking baby steps to grow with caution.” 
Hawkeye Vintage has always had a leg-up, with Goodwin’s dedication to the creation of lasting customer and supplier relationships a cornerstone of the company’s success. 
“We love travelling to meet our buyers and suppliers so that we can create face-to-face relationships. We continue to maintain relationships with them and have managed to collaborate even with the current distance.”
Goodwin's global relationships have created a wealth of quality, vintage pieces for her customers. A competitive advantage that is tough for any others to replicate.
“We are really lucky to have a high supply volume and with that we can offer something to most customers who make a request - this has been great especially in recent times.”
However, with a supply chain largely reliant on a select group of international licensed dealers, it was important for Hawkeye Vintage to be able to make fast, simple and on-time international payments. That’s when Goodwin discovered Airwallex could both make this simple and save significantly on the cost.
“Before Airwallex we were struggling with ways to pay certain suppliers. We were just using our regular bank, PayPal or AMEX - we found it just wasn’t tidy enough and had extra fees on top. Today, Airwallex has saved us over $10,000 each month when we pay our international suppliers.”
Goodwin says that Airwallex, with its streamlined system and global account management service, has helped make international transfers much easier than in the past.  
“It’s easy to send money to buyers and suppliers in any currency. You receive a notification once it’s dispatched and it has eliminated the worry factor of where our money is at. This is important for us to keep building a strong relationship with our suppliers.”
Vintage in the time of coronaHawkeye Vintage, like most businesses, has experienced dramatic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The fast-growing brand had to cancel a string of pop-up shops in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
But like any savvy business owner, Goodwin found a way to adapt her business into one that was viable, and indeed profitable, throughout this period.
“We had to move our business online quickly and find different ways to engage our customers. We hosted our first live sale on Instagram live and it was a huge hit with our customers. With these live events, we’re actually reaching many more customers on a global scale than our pop-up stores would have.”
What’s in-store for Hawkeye Vintage?
Goodwin continues to apply her signature hawkeye to the world’s rarest vintage pieces, and you can expect to see plenty more of the company’s lavish collection in the online arena.
“In the next six months, we have a schedule of Instagram live sales with 1000+ items at each event. My team and I will be hosting these live Instagram events to auction our best pieces. We’ve even got a few collaborations planned with other businesses to run these live virtual events.”
Hawkeye Vintage chooses Airwallex for their international payments. You too can make payments to your international suppliers fast, easy and cost-effective.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/break-even-analysis,Break-even analysis: The #1 reason most eCommerce businesses fail to scale,"BlogBreak-even analysis: The #1 reason most eCommerce businesses fail to scaleJoe Romeo18 September 2020•7 minutesE-commerceGuidesIn this article•What is a break-even analysis?•Why a break-even analysis is critical for eCommerce businesses•How to perform a break-even analysis•How to calculate your break-even point•2 levers for improving your unit economics•Airwallex is the smarter way to do your business bankingWhen starting a new business, simply breaking even isn’t your end goal. You want to make a profit. This isn't an easy journey with 9 out of 10 e-Commerce businesses failing within the first 4 months. In a survey of 1,253 owners of failed UK start-ups by MarketingSignals, two of the top five reasons for failure included running out of cash (32%) and price or costing issues (29%).So breaking even is an important milestone for every eCommerce business aim for, and to celebrate. Knowing your break-even point helps you plan for your future. And a break-even analysis is your key to mapping out your business’ pricing strategy that will get you there.What is a break-even analysis?A break-even analysis is a tool that business owners can use to determine at what point their business will break even, and start to become profitable. It’s a formula you can use to determine your total fixed business costs and the amount of stock you need to sell or income goal you need to hit to cover these business costs completely.And while your break-even point will be determined by this formula, the work that goes into reaching this number is invaluable to understanding your business’ financials.Why a break-even analysis is critical for eCommerce businessesIt helps you set clear, logical goalsYou’re dealing with unit volumes, so it helps you see exactly what costs go into each unit of your stock, and how many units you need to sell each month to cover your operating costs. Using these figures, you can create a clear pricing strategy for your products, and identify where you need to change your sales tactics.You’ll then know how to set your sales targets and what you’re able to safely spend on acquisition so that you can build a profitable business. You’ll make smarter plans for the futurePerforming a break-even analysis can help you determine if a new sales avenue is going to be profitable. You’ll be able to get peace of mind when migrating all your Amazon sales to your own central website or determine whether it’s worth the time and effort attending sales events or operating a short-term pop-up location.It also helps you reduce potential business risk. By undertaking a break-even analysis before launching a new product, or pursuing a new business opportunity, you’ll be able to easily tell if it’s unlikely to be profitable, and you can avoid sinking your time and money into something that ultimately won’t work out.And from a growth point of view, it provides you with a tangible tool you can use when applying for finance, or enticing investors. By providing a clear break-even point for your business, you can demonstrate that you’ve mapped out your business’ cashflow and are planning for the future. Ready to work out your break-even point now? Download our free breakeven calculator by clicking the button below.How to perform a break-even analysisTo calculate break-even point based on units, divide your total fixed costs by the sale price per unit minus the variable cost per unit (margin). In order to find the break-even point accurately, you first need to determine your business’ fixed costs and variable costs. What is a fixed cost?These are the costs that your business must pay each month, or year. They’re the costs that remain roughly the same, regardless of your business’ income.This covers things like your rent or a mortgage, insurance, utility costs, product storage costs, and software subscriptions. Essentially, it’s what you spend on your business, rather than producing your stock. If you're using our break-even template,  fill out your business fixed costs in the currency you're charged into the table marked Step 1, just like below.What is a variable cost?Variable costs are the individual costs that go into making or selling one unit of your stock, which are subject to change for any reason.Say, for example, you sell something like magnetic bottle openers painted in football team colours, that you source from Vietnam. You’ve got your individual costs for the materials. There are costs for labour to paint them. There are costs for packaging, postage, and even payment processing fees for transferring money internationally to your supplier.Add these into the Variable Costs table within your break-even analysis tool to find your break-even point.How to calculate your break-even pointNow that you've determined your fixed and variable costs, its time to calculator your break-even point in units. This is the magic number of how many units you need to sell in a given period, in this case, a month, in order to break even.To calculate your unit break-even point, divide your total fixed costs by your sale price minus your variable costs to land at your break-even number.Example: Break-even unitsYou sell your magnetic bottle openers for $15 each. Sourcing, labour, packaging, posting, and everything else comes to $10 per item.Your total fixed costs for your storage space, office rent, subscriptions to your creative tools, and your utilities, comes to $1,700.Example: Break-even point in sales dollarsThis follows a similar process, but involves the product’s contribution margin in your calculations.The contribution margin is the percentage of your product’s sales cost that’s left after all the product costs are paid for—so the percentage of the sales price that contributes to your profit.Our free break-even tool can calculate all this for you automatically. Click the Try now button below to get your free copy.2 levers for improving your unit economicsThe seemingly obvious way to lower your break-even point is to raise the prices of your product.But it’s not that easy. Customers are sensitive to price increases. They don’t like change. This can backfire, and cause a drop in your customer base. So if this method looks like it could price you out of the market, it’s better to look at your costs instead.1. Lower your fixed costsYou’ve mapped out all your fixed costs, so now find the unnecessary ones that you can remove. It might be looking at better-priced storage options, finding a cheaper internet provider, or seeing if you can negotiate a rent reduction. It might mean stopping spending on some aspects altogether.Or, it can be as simple as switching from a bank account with a monthly fee to a fee-free account. This is where Airwallex can help you out. You pay no fees on your business accounts, ever -and you can open global accounts in 11 currencies, so you won’t have to pay international transfer fees either. This one easy change means you can permanently reduce banking costs for your business.It might sound small, but these add up quickly.2. Lower your variable costsLowering your variable takes a little more effort. It can include searching for suppliers who offer more competitive rates on your stock, or offer better bulk rates. You may be able to find a production plant with cheaper labour costs, or a courier that offers better prices.You could streamline your processes. Perhaps your packaging doesn’t need that added layer of wrapping, or you might stop including bonus stickers and postcards in all your packages.Another way is looking at the fees you pay on your banking. For example, if you source your products internationally, you’re likely paying international transaction fees.Both Airwallex Multi Currency Cards and Foreign Currency Accounts help you cut out international transaction fees altogether. You’ll also receive a foreign exchange rate that’s up to 90% better than what any of the big banks can offer. You’ll be able to reduce your spending costs, reduce your fees, and lower your break-even point all at the same time.Airwallex is the smarter way to do your business bankingNow that you understand your business’ break-even point, it’s time to start making it as cost-effective as possible.So if you’re looking to reduce your expenses, get the best price on your international payments, and say goodbye to bank fees for good, get in touch with Airwallex today.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/card-payment-acceptance-in-the-uk-and-europe,Airwallex debuts card payment acceptance in the UK and Europe to support surging ecommerce growth,"BlogAirwallex debuts card payment acceptance in the UK and Europe to support surging ecommerce growth15 September 2020•3 minutesCompany newsGlobal fintech leader Airwallex has launched its card payment acceptance solution in the United Kingdom and Europe allowing merchants to accept card payments around the world seamlessly and securely. The solution will initially support Visa and Mastercard card payments, with more payment methods planned. In the UK alone, ecommerce sales are expected to grow by 17.6% compared to last year in light of COVID-19. Airwallex has seen double digit revenue growth from its ecommerce customers in 2020, fuelled by the rapid acceleration of online spending globally. As businesses look further afield for growth opportunities, the importance of removing the unnecessary foreign exchange fees charged by banks and other payment providers has never been more critical. These fees are often hidden within inflated exchange rates, additional international payment fees, as well as auto-conversion by issuers and gateways at extremely poor rates. Airwallex’s card payment acceptance solution enables merchants to receive funds from anywhere in the world Visa and Mastercard are accepted – They can then hold these funds in Airwallex accounts in over 15 currencies, exchange currencies at the mid-market rate with a small transparent margin, and repatriate funds back to home markets with zero payment fees. This makes the process simpler, more cost-effective, and totally transparent for merchants.This new offering is a key part of Airwallex’s mission to support business growth with an end-to-end financial services platform. Now, merchants in the UK and Europe can access payments, collections, FX, and virtual global accounts in a single platform, and without the high fees that traditionally come with operating overseas. By working seamlessly with Airwallex’s platform to enable efficient management of multiple currencies, the new solution eliminates the need to work with multiple providers or to open bank accounts in different markets.The new card payment acceptance solution is aimed to go live in other key markets such as Australia and Hong Kong later this year.James Butland, VP of Global Banking said: “Ecommerce merchants today have access to many tech-driven ecommerce solutions that can help them easily set up and run their international operations. Existing cross-border financial services, which is a crucial part of this process, do not offer the same seamless experience. Merchants have to patch together different finance solutions to accept payments, repatriate funds from other markets and pay suppliers – these include payment gateways, business bank accounts in different markets, FX providers and remittance solutions. Managing these different solutions can be cumbersome and costly, and as a result, become a barrier to successful global expansion.”“With the introduction of our new card payment acceptance product Airwallex now offers everything a merchant needs to operate internationally in an end-to-end platform at the lowest cost. As ecommerce growth continues to accelerate Airwallex is committed to bringing products and services to market that help scale the digital economy and support businesses of all sizes in operating globally.” This announcement follows the Airwallex’s recent record US$160million Series D fundraising in April and is further evidence of the company’s commitment in the UK and mainland Europe, with plans to hire 50+ new talent in the region by 2021. This already includes Nigel Thacker, SVP Sales, who recently joined the London office and will take an instrumental role in expanding the European team alongside James Butland, VP of Global Banking. With more than 20 years of experience in the finance industry, Thacker was formerly SVP of Sales at Adyen and also worked for Vocalink, Barclays and RBS. If you have any questions or would like to request further information, please contact Michael Treacy at [email protected]Ready to scale your business with Airwallex?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-sheet-society-gears-up-for-global-growth,Sheet Society gears up for global growth,"BlogSheet Society gears up for global growth14 September 2020•4 minsCustomer storiesSheet Society was dreamt up by Hayley and Andy Worley in 2017, with a simple idea to create a memorable night’s sleep that is uncomplicated and stress free. From humble beginnings in a shared working space to their second warehouse expansion, the team has experienced a staggering increase in sales since COVID-19. The bedding mecca is now gearing up for launching into the US and UK.Sheet Society helps you dress your bed as you would dress yourselfHayley spent years in the fast-fashion industry with a passion for matching beautiful colours and fabrics. Over time, Hayley lost interest in fashion but still wanted to challenge her love for design and create something new. “One day, I walked into work and knew it was time for a change, so I decided bed sheets were for me”, shared Hayley.
Hayley decided to transform the way people dressed their beds, inspired by Koala’s story for the mattress industry. “Koala paved the way for customers to buy products online, that you previously needed to see and touch in person.”
Sheet Society has blown apart the industry norm of buying in ‘sets’ and overemphasis on thread counts. With Sheet Society, it’s simple to ‘mix and match’. Customers don’t need to worry about ‘matching sets’ anymore, with a timeless colour palette to choose from that compliments across all ranges.

Relentless focus on the customer, from product to the check-out Since its inception, Sheet Society team continually challenge themselves to deliver better customer experiences.
As a digital-first business, the team knew exactly how customers navigated their site. When they saw customers dropping off in final moments of check out, it was a no brainer to invest in making payments seamless. Today, customers can choose from nine different ways to pay.
“Your customers' problems are our problems to solve. The improvements in our conversion rates have paid back our efforts to minimise this friction,” said Hayley.
Most recently, Sheet Society has launched Australia’s first augmented reality bed builder. Customers can experience Sheet Society’s range in their bedrooms and see how the bedspread matches everything else around it.

Managing a high-growth, global cash flowEarly on, the team knew it was important to partner with an accountant who specialised in digital-first, global eCommerce businesses. With the rapid growth trajectory Sheet Society was experiencing, they needed an advisor that could keep them anchored on the bigger picture.
“As a fully digital business, we couldn’t just look at the cost of the product, but also the cost of selling that product. We needed to factor in things like digital marketing spend, merchant fees and currency conversion fees on each sale.”Their accountant saw the opportunity to improve profits by removing the expensive international conversion fees each time they paid their overseas suppliers and SaaS subscriptions. With Airwallex Borderless Virtual Cards, the team could reinvest their savings back into the business to keep up with the skyrocketing customer demand.“These small percentages here and there add up over time with a real bottom line impact. When I see the rates are good, I’ll convert my AUD into USD [in Airwallex], knowing that I’ve saved money I can re-invest into the business in the long-run.”What’s ahead for Sheet Society?“We’re fortunate to be in the right product category during this time. We’re now set to turn over $15m in revenue this year which just blows my mind!”, said Andy.With this accelerated growth, the team is going back to the drawing board to build the right foundations to scale the business. The future plans include moving into a 10x bigger warehouse to be able to keep up with the demand, as well as launching in the US and UK markets.
“One of the biggest challenges of going global is the logistics. We need to be able to ship our products fast, especially as these countries have a higher expectation on shipping times.”One thing the team does not need to worry about is setting up foreign accounts. With Airwallex, the team can easily set up US and UK Foreign Currency Accounts, connect their global AfterPay account to collect in local currencies. Global expansion is now one step easier.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/crockd-customer-story,"Crockd, how an Aussie side hustle accelerated into a global brand","BlogCrockd, how an Aussie side hustle accelerated into a global brand7 September 2020•5 minutesCustomer storiesWith a mission to create a world of limitless potential through fearless creativity, Crockd provides ‘at-home’ pottery experiences. Airwallex has enabled Crockd to scale from zero to 7 figures within six months. They currently operate across Australia, New Zealand and the US. Crockd helps friends get their hands dirty and minds clearIn late 2019, Andrew Ford and Rosa-Clare Willis were working in technology start-ups based out of Gold Coast, Australia. They felt burnt out and wanted a way to disconnect from technology.

As an alternative to consuming alcohol with friends, the duo invited their friends along to get their hands on clay and just muck around. They wanted to experience all the benefits of the creative process without the intimidation of a formal workshop.

Laughter ensued as they tried hand-building clay for the first time. The collective experience was something special, memorable and unifying. Hands got dirty. Deep conversation ensued.

And so, Crockd was born.

The founders saw a unique opportunity in the market as people shift towards ‘at-home’ experiences. “Less people are going to the movies, more are using Netflix. Less people are going to restaurants, and more people are ordering Uber Eats. People want to enjoy these comforts from their home.”
Thinking global from day oneFrom day one, Crockd built their business with scale in mind. As they set up their shipping, teams and banking systems, they needed to operate as if they had 1,000 customers a month globally. 

“We wanted to be the most sophisticated craft business in the world. What were the technologies that could enable a product-focused business with a purpose to scale?”

From the start, Crockd picked a fulfilment partner that could provide both domestic and global shipping. Crockd also needed to bring home foreign currency revenue, pay their US-based suppliers and remote teams without the expensive foreign transaction costs or overhead from managing multiple bank accounts.

“Even though you are domestically Australian, you are in a global marketplace now. It just doesn’t work anymore to only have an Australian bank account.”

Even before having a domestic bank account, they signed up with Airwallex as their global business account. Within 24 hours, they had Australian and US accounts, with multi-currency virtual cards to manage their SaaS spend. Crockd could transact in all the major currencies in one place - saving at least $1,200 each month from foreign exchange fees. All of which is reinvested back into the business and improving the customer experience.

This scalable eCommerce tech stack allowed them to launch in the USA within 3 weeks of planning their expansion.

“Airwallex has allowed us to get things done at ten times the speed it used to happen. It means we could spend more time on our brand, our website and the customer experience. That’s what helped us to grow so much in a short span of time. These solutions just didn’t exist a few years ago.”
Building a scalable brand experience and frictionless systems“We didn’t want there to be friction for someone to be creative, and that’s intertwined in our system and our brand.”

For Crockd’s brand, this means that they have intentionally crafted a style that is androgynous to remove any stigma for who their target customer should look like. Anyone, no matter their skill level or background, could connect with the Crockd product and see themselves experiencing it.

“Airwallex has made managing our money frictionless so that we can spend less time on the back-end that doesn’t add any value to our customer. Instead,  really focus on delivering a better customer experience on a global scale.”

Crockd has automated their multi-currency reconciliation, payroll and recurring supplier payments with Airwallex - saving hours each week. While still retaining visibility with proactive payment notifications and resolution steps.

Like any product-based business who lives or dies by their cash flow, Crockd needed a real-time pulse on their global cash flow. Having their shipping, banking and payroll systems integrate into Xero has given the team the visibility and trust they need to make fast, data-driven decisions.

Airwallex’s proactive transaction notifications also allow Crockd to resolve issues 30% faster than their previous experiences with traditional providers.
What’s ahead for Crockd“With growth, we can either focus on the same market and create new products. Or take the same product to new markets - which our systems have made it easy for us to do.”

The most important challenge for the founders now while they expand is how they maintain the Crockd brand ethos. “We’re a business focused on creating conversations, and pottery is just one of the catalysts for it.”
Accelerate your global growth like Crockd with Airwallex foreign currency accounts.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/protecting-your-online-store-from-fraud,Six easy strategies for protecting your online store from fraud,"BlogSix easy strategies for protecting your online store from fraud21 August 2020•4 minutesFinanceIn this article•Detecting fraud can be difficult, but there are warning signs•6 easy strategies to manage fraud online•Protect your staff and your business from online fraud with virtual cardsAs more and more businesses pivot to online sales, the corresponding rise in online fraud is inevitable. And, every day, hackers and fraudsters are finding new and ‘creative’ ways to attack online businesses, scamming them out of money and goods.We know—that’s a pretty heavy paragraph to open with. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Once you understand how to identify online fraud, then you’re already giving yourself a greater chance to put strategies in place to better manage these situations.Detecting fraud can be difficult, but there are warning signsThe big problem is that online fraud can be so sophisticated these days that you may not even be able to tell it’s occurring. We say ‘can be’, because if you check your email spam folder there’s going to be at least one phishing email about a mystery consignment from a US General or a long lost family member. Online fraud that occurs against small businesses, though, is a lot more complex.However, there are some red flags to be aware of that may help you identify potential fraud incidents. You can look for:Suspicious customer contact information. This can include things like email addresses that are just a string of letters and numbers, or poorly-spelled namesOrders to the same address using a variety of different cards or using different contact detailsLarge order from clients who don’t usually make large ordersLarge orders all of the same itemAn order where the billing and shipping addresses are differentA random international order, or large volumes of orders from new countriesOrders made at strange hours. While they may be made during business hours in Australia, 3am in Russia isn’t a typical time to be making many online purchases
While these occurrences aren’t necessarily a guarantee of online fraud, being aware of the red flags is the first step to managing fraud in the future.
6 easy strategies to manage fraud onlineHere are six easy strategies you can put in place that help protect your business and your clients against online fraud.1. Be on the lookout for account takeoversCustomer accounts that have been lying dormant for a while are vulnerable to account takeovers. This is where a fraudster has gotten hold of those account details—whether it’s through hacking, ATM skimming, or they’ve bought the details from some shady source—and use them to make purchases. It’s essentially identity theft for that account.They then use this account to buy goods for themselves using the account's details.It’s possible to spot this type of fraud when it occurs. If you notice that a dormant account has suddenly sprung back to life, and then it starts doing something suspicious like making bulk purchases or changing their account details completely, then this can be an indicator of an account takeover. If multiple customer accounts all suddenly change their details, particularly if they change them to one shared set of details, this is a big red flag of an account takeover.While it’s difficult to combat in the moment, you can put methods in place to prevent future account takeovers. Outside of recommending your customers change their passwords regularly, two-factor authentication can be a strong tool in fighting this type of online fraud.2. Use two-factor authenticationTwo-factor authentication provides that added layer of safety for your customers’ accounts when managing purchases. You probably already use it in one form or another, perhaps in your Gmail account, or your ATO online portal identification.Now, while sending confirmation of an order via both text and email to your customers might sound like overkill, it’s a simple way to confirm that the person using the account to make the order is legitimate.And if you do use two-factor authentication and the customer’s details immediately change, then you know you’ve got a scammer on your hands.
3. Use virtual cards for payments and change them regularlyOnline fraud isn’t confined just to your customers. Your business can come under threat in your everyday business dealings—particularly when it comes to your payments.One strategy to combat this is with virtual payment cards. Virtual payment cards are exactly what they sound like: a virtual debit card that you create for specific payment needs. Creating virtual payment cards for you and your teams is a great way to monitor your spending, and ensure there’s nothing going awry. The beauty of virtual payment cards is that you can set their spending limit and even their lifetime, so the card details can be rendered obsolete after a certain timeframe, or after a set number of payments. And as there’s no physical card, there’s nothing that can go missing or be stolen, either.Virtual payment cards are a safer, more secure way to manage your business’ spending online.
4. Double-check shipping detailsAs outlined above, suspicious shipping details can be a red flag that something isn’t quite right. This can indicate that someone has taken over that account and is using it for their own ends.Fraudsters can make last-minute changes to their shipping details at check-out, meaning you send it to a different address to their billing. They may also be shipping goods to vacant blocks, empty houses, or new buildings. One tricky thing to look for, is any direction in the shipping details that can indicate that the packages may be rerouted during shipping.Double-checking these details means you have a better understanding of where your products are headed, and whether anything seems amiss.5. Defend your business and your customers against card testingIf you run an eCommerce business you should be aware of a type of fraud known as ‘card testing’. In this scenario, thieves are using your business’ payment portal to test the details of stolen credit cards to see if they work. This includes both physical credit cards and virtual cards.It’s gotten to the point where fraudsters can use a script-based program that tests thousands of credit card credentials all at once.One way that can help you get around this is by adding security measures like CAPTCHAs to your checkout pages, or any page where card information is required. High volume card testing scripts, and even bots, can be caught out by CAPTCHAs, and this can help distinguish card testing from human activity.6. Do your due diligenceTaking a first-hand approach can provide that added layer of security, and peace of mind, that you’re doing everything you can to combat online fraud. Now, this one takes time on your part, but it can be worth it.Check your orders. If an order rings some alarm bells for you, look up the address and phone number. You can do a quick google search, or check the White Pages. If no hits come up, or the address doesn't seem to correspond with the order, it could be fraudulent activity.Check the IP address too. If the biller’s postal address is in Sydney, but the IP address is coming from another country altogether, then you might have an issue.Yes, this method does require you to do some digging—but a little personal insight can go a long way.Protect your staff and your business from online fraud with virtual cardsWe know all too well the damage debit card fraud can have on businesses, so we created our virtual payment cards as a way to help combat this.Airwallex Borderless Cards can be created within seconds, and you can start using them instantly. This allows you to make payments quickly, thus limiting the chance for their details to somehow be stolen. You can also set your cards for single-use, so as soon as the payment is made the card is rendered useless.All your card spend details are logged automatically, and you can assign specific payment codes to your cards so you know exactly where your money should be going. We’ve created Borderless Cards to be as easy for you to use as possible, so much so that you’re able to replace your cards regularly, further limiting your chance for fraud to occur.Airwallex is working towards making managing your finances as safe and secure as possible.

Automate your recurring invoices•Recurring contracts? Get on the payroll•Auto-reconcile your expense management•You also get better oversight of your spend•Automate your document signing•And that’s only the tip of the iceberg•Airwallex helps make your expense management easySome people love admin work. Others… not so much.So in the veritable explosion of business process automation, it’s no surprise that business administration and expense management were some of the first fields to receive a helping hand. If you’re one of those people who dreads the end of the month and winces every time you hear the word ‘invoice’, we’ve got some good news. Here are some quick tips that you can incorporate into your workflow this week to help you automate and streamline the time-heavy processes you deal with in your daily expense management. 
Automate your paymentsRaising invoices, chasing up payments, and logging each takes up your time, and often feels like more of a headache than it’s worth. The simple act of automating how your payments are made can save you untold hours not just each month, but on an ongoing basis.
Automate your recurring invoicesInstead of manually raising or paying your invoices, many accounting platforms have the option to schedule recurring invoice generation. This is ideal if you have regular recurring invoices to pay for things like services, stock, logistics or security.While the actual mechanics will vary from platform to platform, the idea itself is simple. You just send the invoice amount, assign a cost code (if required), determine the specific time and date to make the payment, and then set the process live. Just set it and forget it, and your invoices will be paid—or sent out—on time, every time, each month.Recurring contracts? Get on the payrollIf you have a supplier or a client who does regular work for you, a smart way to streamline your payments is to invite them to be a part of your payroll. This way, instead of having them send invoices each month and then going through the payment process each time, they get paid automatically as part of your regular pay run.Their details are already in your system, their expense is already budgeted for, and it gets taken care of automatically, without having to manually enter and pay the same invoice each month.Conversely, you could also consider having this conversation with a client for whom you do regular work. This way there’s no need to chase up invoices—for either of you.Auto-reconcile your expense managementCut out the time you spend chasing up purchase receipts by using payment cards that automatically sync any transaction details to your accounting software. Imagine that: no more scrambling around to find the right person for this or that payment, no more going from team member to team member just to find out what one random payment was made for.You can also opt in for expense management features to automate your accounting workflows and save all that time you’d normally be spending on hunting for receipts. Borderless Cards are simple to set up, and once they’re created you can start using them immediately. You can create new virtual cards for individual team members too, so you can ensure that the right people are using your cards. This allows you to monitor your budgets in granular detail, which means no more mystery payments, and no more surprises.
You also get better oversight of your spendAuto-reconciliation doesn’t just make the processing side of things easier, it also gives you more security. Your Borderless Card is linked to your bank feed, with each transaction logged in real-time and synced back to Xero hourly. So you can check where and when your money is being spent, and monitor payments as they occur.Not to say you’ll be sitting there watching it like a hawk (although if that’s your thing, we won’t stop you)—auto-reconciliation just makes it easier to monitor and manage your spending, and regularly track it to ensure you’re staying on budget.
Automate your document signingIt would be remiss of us to say that the global pandemic has forced more business to be conducted online. The need for social distancing and remote working has simply sped up what was already becoming a trend.Signing documents is one of those things. There are some great tools out there at the moment which sidestep the need to print documents, hand-sign them, scan them to your computer, and then email them—or worse, require you to sign and post the document by mail.There’s a raft of digital signature apps and services around now that are recognised as acceptable alternatives to the old-fashioned physical copy.DocuSign is one of the most recognised and trustworthy services around at the moment, and with good reason. It’s easy to use, simple to operate, and even allows you to send documents to other people for them to sign, which they can sign and complete for free, without having to sign up for a membership.Imagine it: a world where signing and sending documents is as easy as clicking a button.And that’s only the tip of the icebergAs the world adjusts to the effects of social distancing, we’re looking at more and more ways to perform our work remotely. Along with these quick, easy tips to automate your business expense management, there’s no doubt we’re going to see some exciting innovation in the near future. So it’s important for flexible, future-focused businesses to stay open to new ideas. And who knows—they might even help you learn to love admin.Airwallex helps make your expense management easyCreate your free borderless account today to better manage your business expenses with Borderless Cards and Expenses.

And with the sheer size and volume of manufacturing plants in China, it makes sense that this would be one of your first avenues. So if you’re wondering how to find a manufacturer in China, read on.How to find a manufacturer in ChinaFinding a manufacturer or sourcing a supplier in China is a little more involved than looking for one locally. International directoriesThanks to the booming e-commerce industry there are now plenty of online directories out there where you can search for manufacturers or suppliers in your desired industry. You can find profiles for manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers, and see reviews to make sure they’re right for you.Some of the most popular international directories include:Oberlo is a Shopify-recommended integration that allows you to search for a manufacturing or wholesale partner.Alibaba is one of the world’s biggest online marketplaces for merchants.Aliexpress is an offshoot of Alibaba, and aimed more at B2C customers - but you’re still able to contact the manufacturers directly.Tradewheel.com is a popular trading platform that’s growing fast, so may be able to find a supplier who’s just starting out and get in on the ground floor with them.Internet searchesOne issue with an internet search is that you’re searching for an international company while in Australia, so the search results are most likely going to be Australian businesses.When sourcing a supplier in China, you’ll need to dig a little deeper than the first page of Google. You’ll also need to use the right keywords. Search for companies with ‘wholesale’, ‘supplier’, or ‘distributor’ as a keyword.While this method might prove fruitful, there are better ways to find the right manufacturer in China.ReferralsReferrals will always deliver reliable results. Much like a business, if a colleague recommends a supplier to you, and they’ve had good experiences with them, you’re likely to have similar experiences. This is an endorsement you can trust. So, reach out to your professional connections to collect leads to follow. Ask for recommendations. You can also get out there and join groups on LinkedIn, Facebook, and other online communities. Use these networks to get in touch with people and businesses in your field who sell similar products, and chase them up to find out who they recommend.Asking for referrals from colleagues or business partners will deliver better results than going down the Google rabbit hole. 
Is this manufacturer legit?Once you’ve learned how to source suppliers or manufacturers for your products, it’s important to check to make sure everything they do is above board, and that they can deliver on what they promise. For some initial intel, you can check online reviews, such as Google or Facebook reviews. If you want to dig a little deeper, try giving them a call. Speak to a real person, quiz them about their business.One way to determine if they’re on the level is to ask about visiting the factory. If they’ve got nothing to hide, they’ll have no problem with you taking a tour of the factory to see where your products are made. If they make excuses or refuse, then this is a big red flag that they might not be 100% legitimate.Unfortunately, there’s no Chinese equivalent to the ACCC where you can cross-check the manufacturer to confirm whether or not they’ve had complaints filed against them. The closest you’ll get is the user-generated content on SupplierBlacklist.com. This platform allows you to log in and post reviews and complaints about suppliers, which are shared on the front page with the rest of the community.
Requesting and comparing quotesLike onshore businesses, it’s always useful to compare quotes from your desired suppliers to find who can do you the best deal. There are a few things to consider when looking for quotes.
Check their sample priceBe sure to ask for sample pricing vs production pricing. Sample pricing is the cost to have a few sample products made first, to see the quality of the product you’re shipping. Sample pricing will vary depending on the supplier, and be aware that some manufacturers may not offer sample pricing. Alternatively, some may offer free samples.Confirm production priceThis is how much your products will actually cost when rolling them out for production. Be sure to ask for prices for several quantity sizes. Check to see if they can offer you a bulk order discount—it never hurts to ask.
Turnaround timeCheck the turnaround time, too. It’s no use partnering with a supplier who takes months to deliver.
Order quantitiesAsk your supplier to find out the minimum order quantity available to merchants. This is a critical step; manufacturers typically create products on a mass scale, so the minimum order you’ll make is likely to be in the hundreds, if not thousands.Confirm that the minimum order is both affordable for you, and going to deliver a solid return on investment. Minimum order quantities will vary from supplier to supplier, so find one that suits your needs.In some cases, there may even be scope to negotiate a minimum order. To do so, find out why your product costs what it costs. Does the manufacturer prefer working with larger buyers? Is it labour-intensive to make? You might be able to negotiate a smaller production run at a higher price, but still have it fit within your budget.
Confirming your payment termsBe mindful when diving into a discussion around payment terms. Some manufacturers require full payment upfront (which is what you’ll see mentioned regularly on SupplierBlacklist.com). If you’re a new startup, this can be a sizable outlay.When confirming payment terms, you can send a simple email to your potential supplier to check the details. Don’t be put off if you don’t receive a response on payment terms. These manufacturers receive hundreds of emails and requests for quotes and payment terms, many of which don’t end up panning out, so some may not even respond.To ensure you actually receive a response from your manufacturer, keep your initial email simple. Don’t give them your backstory and a three-year plan. Just say who you are, what your business does, and ask pertinent questions about the stock you're after. Keep it short and businesslike. Only ask about a handful of pricing quantities, the minimum information you need to get your business off the ground. Also, find out what their minimum quote is first. This way you can determine if they’re actually a good fit, and you don’t turn them off by requesting a quote for a quantity that’s outside of their manufacturing guidelines.
Insurance and coverageThere are a number of insurance and liability covers available for importers and manufacturers within Australia. Getting the right insurance protects you against loss or damage at any point in your supply chain, right from the manufacturing process, through to transport (goods in transit cover), and even once you’re distributing it to your customers.As an e-commerce business, at a minimum you should consider:Product liability insurance. This is particularly relevant to ensure you’re safe against any claims against your product by the end-user.Business insurance. This protects your stock against damage or theft.As an online business you should also consider coverage against cyber threats, which can include:Privacy protection insuranceBreach coverage, to protect against any data breaches and recovery, andHacker insurance (yes, it’s a thing).
While you can look into this yourself, an insurance broker can work with you to find you the best deal and insurance cover that’s appropriate for your business.DistributionFinding the right distribution partner for your products is critical to your business success. Your manufacturer may be able to refer you to their preferred distribution partner, otherwise, consider asking around for referrals, much like when you were looking at how to find suppliers when you started the process. A good distribution partner will allow you to leverage their networks, and get your products sent and distributed faster.

Your accounts payable•Your accounts receivable•So, what’s the difference?•How the accounts payable process works•Our top tips for managing your accounts payable process•Track your due dates and to improve cash flow•Put your expense management on autopilot•Airwallex helps you improve your accounts payable processHuman beings crave structure. We love systems, patterns, and repetition. The same goes for your business’ finances. The act of improving your accounts payable processes will allow you to gain control over your business’ cashflow, and allow you to put a structure around how you make your payments.And with this structure comes growth.In this article, we’re going to guide you to improve the management of your business’ accounts payable process and provide you with actionable tips that you can implement now and over the course of the year.Let’s start by defining what we mean by ""accounts payable"".
Your accounts payableThis is the money that’s owed by your business to other entities, whether it’s to pay your suppliers, pay for services, or cover your bills and other liabilities. Your accounts payable typically covers short-term debts that you can pay off within the year—anything longer than this, like a loan or a mortgage, aren’t included.Your accounts receivableThis is money that’s owed to your business for your services or the products you sell, from your customers, clients, or elsewhere, that hasn’t yet been paid. As soon as you send your customer or client an invoice, this means that sum of money is now part of your accounts receivable until it gets paid.So, what’s the difference?Essentially, accounts payable is your outgoing funds—the amount of money you owe—and your accounts receivable is your incoming funds—the amount of money that’s owed to you.How the accounts payable process worksAccounts payable can become a murky world if you dive too deeply into it, so we’ll keep it simple.Your accounts payable process takes place in three steps:1. A purchase order is completedThis is a list of the items or services you’re paying for. This will include the prices, any terms or conditions that govern the transaction, and the timeframe for payment.2. A receiving report is processedThe supplier makes a record of the goods or services that they provided to you, and the amount of money that you owe them. This report will go into specific detail about the goods or services, so it’s important to read this carefully to ensure you’re getting what you paid for.
3. You receive and process the invoiceYour supplier will then send you the invoice for their services or goods, and your business will process it. Much like the point above, it’s important to read this invoice carefully and ensure that what they’re saying they supplied actually matches what you received.
4. You pay the invoiceOnce you’ve checked and processed the invoice, it’s time to send money through for payment.Our top tips for managing your accounts payable process
Centralise your payments to a single accountConsolidate all your finances to ensure all your money comes into and goes out of one central business account. This way you’ve only got one account to keep track of, and all your cash flow is tracked against this one location. This makes it much easier to monitor and provides you with one source of truth when it comes to your business’ finances.Track your due dates and to improve cash flowAs we’ve said before, good cash flow management is essential in growing your business. Actively tracking the due dates of your invoices means you know exactly when each one needs to be paid, so you’re able to take better control of your payments.Paying your invoices and debts on their respective due dates means that you can delay payment until it’s absolutely necessary, ensuring you keep money in your account for longer. This means that you have funds available should you need them, and if your account generates interest, you’re able to make a little extra money just from having this money stay in your account. Granted, it’s not much, but each little bit does add up.Tracking your due dates also means you know when and why money is leaving your account. Without this structure, making irregular and ad hoc payments for your invoices means you’ll never accurately understand how and where your money is being spent. Tracking these dates, and understanding the regularities and patterns behind them, means you’ll better understand your business’ turnover, and even enable you to forecast your future cashflow.Airwallex makes it easy to pay your invoices on time with our International Payments. You can use your International Payments to pay your suppliers anywhere in the world, in up to 34 different currencies, within 1-2 business days. You can schedule your payments so that you pay your invoices just before their due dates, keeping your cash flow consistent. 
Have a clear authorisation processWithout a clear authorisation process, payments can get made without your oversight, errors can occur, and your budget will go out the window. A defined authorisation process improves accountability as there’s always a clear and traceable chain of responsibility. If a payment gets made, it must go through at least one approval—or even better, two. Double sign-off means there’s even less chance of making payment errors and ensures a higher level of scrutiny than simply the team manager or department head.Where this double sign-off occurs depends on your business. It can be authorised at a by-department level, for smaller payments, or with your finance department for larger, irregular spending. It’s always good to get a second set of eyes over your work, so why wouldn’t you do it with your finances? This ensures that all payments receive the level of approval they need and that you can always ensure that the right amount of money is leaving your business, for the right reasons.Pay your invoices in larger batchesThink about your payments for a minute. Every time you make a client payment, you’ve got to log into the platform, create the payment, check the details, receive approval, and send the payment.  While it might not seem like much at the time, each minute you do this adds up.Say you make these payments once a day (at a conservative estimate). If you consolidated this time and made all your payments in one large batch, once a week, you would effectively reduce the time spent making your payments by up to 80%.Making large batch payments simplifies your accounts payable process. If all your payments are made at once, it just becomes easier.With Airwallex, you can bundle all your payments together, and make your weekly pay run a breeze. It’s easy to do: just log all your payments into one CSV file, upload it to your Airwallex platform, and you’re good to go. Instead of making small payments here and there, you’re able to get it done all at once, in one hit. You can pay in up to 34 currencies, across all your invoices, all in one simple file list.

What’s the difference between a virtual card and a physical card?•What is a virtual debit card?•The pros and cons of a virtual debit card•Which virtual card is better for my business?•Airwallex Borderless Cards make it easy for you to manage your financesMost virtual cards comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) requirements, which provide added protection for your personal information and account data. Similar to physical cards, safety and security are top priorities when it comes to virtual cards.
Advancements in technology have revolutionised banking security, and now virtual payments offer a level of security that surpasses that of physical cards when purchasing goods and services online. An appealing bonus feature of virtual credit and debit cards is the max spend or charge limit option. 
Virtual credit and debit cards are quickly becoming the preferred option for modern businesses all across Australia. 
Let’s take a look at what each of these products actually are, the differences between these two types of cards and how each one can benefit your business.
What is a virtual credit card?A virtual credit card exists entirely online but can be used in exactly the same way as your regular credit card. You receive a unique 16-digit string of numbers that acts as your credit card number, plus your expiry date and CVV. You can use it anywhere you would your normal credit card — over the phone, online and even in person (if you have the details).
Any charges made on your virtual credit card are routed back to your existing credit card, using your current line of credit. 
The pros and cons of a virtual credit cardThe prosVirtual credit cards allow you to access funds using credit without the need for a physical credit card. They can be created online in seconds, providing you with a payment option when you need it.
Similar to credit cards, some virtual credit cards allow you to earn points on your purchases, which can then be used for travel, employee incentives and the like. They can be set for single use, meaning once the assigned fund amount is used, the card becomes void. 
If your card gets compromised, it’s easy to cancel. Simply delete or remove the card details from your account, and it becomes void. You can then create a new card that you can start using immediately.The consVirtual credit cards can come with high-interest rates and fees. You can typically expect to pay up to 3% on international transactions.
While they’re a safer option for online purchases, virtual credit cards still act like credit cards. So when compared to a virtual debit card, it’s still possible to incur credit debt beyond your team’s purchase limits. This poses a similar problem for any card hacking, too. 
Your virtual credit card’s lifetime may become a drawback. For example, if you make a business purchase but then need to return the purchase for whatever reason — but your card details have since expired — you may be unable to return the item or receive a refund. If the card details don’t exist anymore, there’s no card to refund to
What’s the difference between a virtual card and a physical card?
In today’s technology-driven world filled with experienced hackers, no virtual or physical card is fully fraud-proof. However, virtual cards function using a temporary account number, which reduces your chances of being hacked. Monitoring a virtual card is easier and more user-friendly than physical card issues, like a lost or stolen card and account management. For security reasons, you can alter and create new card numbers for an added level of security. If you encounter fraudulent charges, virtual and physical cards offer similar protection plans. However, virtual cards offer less hassle in the recovery process. What is a virtual debit card?The same as with virtual credit cards, virtual debit cards are an entirely online product, with no physical form. You get your 16-digit card number and your expiry date. The big difference with a virtual debit card is that it doesn’t work on credit. Any charges you make are drawn from your central account, with your 16-digit card number linked back to that account. Virtual debit cards provide you with all the benefits of a virtual credit card, with a few extra ones, that make them a reduced-risk alternative. The pros and cons of a virtual debit card
The ProsAs we’ve all experienced, cards are easy to lose, particularly if you share them between your team members. Issuing virtual debit cards means you’ll never have these issues again. Your card details are available online, so you don’t need to rummage around in your bag or desk draw to find your details every time you need to make a purchase.They can be set up as single-use, or for a specific time period, so your money is only available to be accessed during this time. This means that should the details fall into the wrong hands there’s less chance for your funds to be spent without your knowledge.The ConsThe security of your virtual debit card can turn into a negative, in the wrong circumstances. If there aren’t enough funds in the connected account, then your virtual debit card payment won’t go through. So while it’s a great little safety feature, it does mean that you’ve got to pay attention to your overall budget availability.Which virtual card is better for my business?As a business, you’ll typically use the same payment details for every online purchase and payment that you make, so either product will do the trick. Determining which virtual card is best for your business is really a matter of your needs.Virtual debit cards regularly provide products without international transaction fees, meaning there’s an easy way to shave up to 3% off all your foreign transactions from purchasing to ongoing software subscriptions.Both types of cards are just as secure as each other, so online safety isn’t a concern. One area where virtual debit cards make more sense is in relation to the control you have over your funds. If you like to run a tight ship, and always know where and how your money is being spent, then a virtual debit card may be a better option. When using a virtual debit card, you’re always only spending money that you have, and not racking up credit card debt. You’ll never have to worry about going over any spending limits, or not paying off your monthly balance.So if debt is a concern, it’s best to choose a virtual debit card for your business needs.

His experience within the eCommerce sector aligns with Airwallex and will help the business branch out into other verticals like sports and the influencer economy.

Airwallex helps you bring your business into the virtual worldIf you’ve ever had to chase accounts for the one office debit card to purchase supplies, then you know how inconvenient it can be.This is where virtual payment cards are changing the game for businesses. Gaining popularity over the past few years, virtual debit and credit cards eliminate the physical element from your purchases altogether. Created and used entirely online, they operate exactly the same way as their physical counterparts. Upon sign-up, you receive a randomly-generated 16-digit number that acts as your card details, complete with a card verification number and expiry date. This virtual debit card can then be used anywhere your physical card would be, with the big benefit that there’s no physical card to lose. You get all the security of a regular card with the flexibility of the virtual world. Virtual debit cards are changing how businesses do banking. So, it’s important to find the one that’s best suited to your business’ needs.Here’s what you should look for, and how to choose the right virtual debit card for your business.Choose the type of payment cardAs well as the typical everyday payment card there are a few variations on what a virtual debit card can offer you, so it’s important to think about how you’ll be using your debit card before you settle on one.You’ve got the standard virtual debit card, which works the same way as your traditional debit card. You can use this for everyday transactions, recurring payments—essentially, anywhere you would typically use your normal debit card.Single-payment virtual debit cards can be created for a specific amount and set to expire once that amount has been used. Think of it like a gift card, but used to pay your suppliers.
Is it easy to open your account?One of the many game-changing aspects of virtual debit cards is that you don’t need to go to a bank branch to open one. You can do it entirely online, and better still, you don’t have to wait 4-5 business days to receive it. When looking into virtual cards, make sure you can open your account completely online. This also makes the application process much quicker. Once you’ve opened your account, confirm how long it is until you can start using your card. As your virtual debit card is on a 16-digit string of numbers, in theory, once you have this you can start using your card immediately.At least, it should be this easy. If there are any more steps involved with creating your virtual debit card, consider looking into another supplier.Exchange rates and fees With the increasing connectedness of the modern world, it’s highly likely that you’ll be using your virtual debit card for international transactions. If you’re making a high volume of such transactions, it’s beneficial to familiarise yourself with your new debit card’s fees and international exchange rates.Check that the supplier clearly and transparently outlines any fees incurred on foreign transactions. Do they offer a fair rate, or use the interbank FX rate?It pays to check these things beforehand, so you’re not slugged with exorbitant and surprise fees each time you use your card internationally, with some providers charging in excess of 3% per transaction.Monthly and other feesWhile we come to expect fees associated with banking, many virtual card providers are bucking the trend and offering competitive fees on their products—or even removing them altogether.So when comparing virtual debit cards, read the full Product Disclosure Statement to check if there are any fees involved. Some suppliers may charge a monthly service fee to use your virtual debit card. Some might even charge a fee for opening an account with them.If so, are they worth it?
Ease of reconciliationVirtual debit cards exist purely online, so it makes sense that they’re more efficient than regular cards. This online nature makes it easy to sync and manage your accounting for each card. You won’t need to keep track of hundreds of receipts anymore, all the information for your payments is stored online. A good virtual debit card will have the ability to sync automatically to your accounting software, with all your information being ported directly across. No double-handling, no waiting 2-3 days to see the latest transaction appear in your account. This allows you to manage your spending in real-time, with up-to-date card statements available at the click of a button.So if efficiency and ease-of-use is your thing, make sure your virtual debit card supplier offers this feature.
Airwallex helps you bring your business into the virtual worldAirwallex Multi-Currency Cards are designed to make your business payments easy.With our virtual debit card option, you can open your business account completely online, and once your account is live you can create new virtual debit cards instantly. There are no card fees, ever, and you get access to our competitive interbank exchange rate, where you’ll only ever pay a minimal 0.3% or 0.6% fee on top of your foreign exchanges. You get full control over your cards, too. Set them for single-use, so once any transaction is made the card is rendered void, or give them an expiry date that suits your needs. You can set budget limits, so you and your teams know exactly how much you’re spending on each card. Your card can also be linked to specific cost codes, so your spend is always tracked. This code is then automatically logged, so you get instant, real-time spend tracking for your budgets. You can save even more time by integrating your Borderless Card with your Xero accounting software for easy monthly reconciliation, with transactions syncing hourly.So when choosing the right virtual debit card for your business, Airwallex makes it easy.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-managing-your-business-software-stack,The ultimate guide to managing your business’ software stack,"BlogThe ultimate guide to managing your business’ software stack24 July 2020•6 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•Audit your software subscriptions •Adopt a password management tool•Automate your account reconciliation process•Save 3% on all USD software subscriptions•Use virtual cards to provide additional security for subscription payments Modern businesses call on an arsenal of software to help run their day-to-day operations – to measure, promote, track, automate, host and collaborate, the list goes on.Keeping track of all your software subscriptions can prove to be a mountainous task, particularly when coordinating across multiple teams, approval processes and payment cards. We’ve come together as a team at Airwallex and pooled our best tips for managing an ever-growing list of software subscriptions. Audit your software subscriptions According to a Blissfully research report, on average, companies with 1-100 employees have 102 active software subscriptions and USD$202,200 in annual subscription spend. To make matters more difficult, many companies struggle to enforce effective processes for managing these expenses, with 71% of businesses identifying that they have software subscriptions without a billing owner.Establishing clear expense management processes is critical for businesses with distributed teams. As managers, we accept that for our team to perform their roles effectively, they need various platforms and tools. Still, we often fail to set clear guidelines and robust processes that scale alongside our organisation’s growth. In Airwallex’s Growth team, we’ve been adding new people and rolling out new marketing, product and sales initiatives. To accompany this, we needed to rethink our processes for managing our growing software stack. We created a simple subscription manager via a Google Sheet to help keep track of software subscriptions, costs, owners and virtual cards in use. It was easy to set up, the sheet was shared internally, team members added subscriptions under their management, and we cross-referenced this against what our finance team had recorded to identify any ‘orphaned’ subscriptions. In less than a week, we not only had visibility of all our software subscriptions and expenditure, but the team identified opportunities to consolidate or cancel subscriptions.Click the purple button at the bottom of your screen for the exact Google Sheet we use and share it with your team to audit your software stack.Adopt a password management toolThere’s nothing more frustrating than trying to log in to a tool you haven’t used in a while and realising you’ve forgotten the password, or worse, a team member has left the business and stranded you without first sharing their login credentials.The best way to prevent this is with a password management tool like LastPass or 1Password. Not only does it make it easier to manage access, but it’ll also train your team to avoid ‘not so safe’ passwords and instil sound security practices. LastPass auto-generates secure passwords each time you sign up for a new subscription and stores them securely in a ‘password vault’. You can also share password access with other teams or stakeholders outside your business, like contractors or agencies, but whilst establishing controls so they can’t see/record your passwords.You can even create ‘team’ password accounts where you can collate and store common logins for tools shared amongst multiple users. This makes onboarding new staff easier, as it means they can start their new role with all the platform access they need. It also minimises the risk that any access will be lost when a member leaves the team.Automate your account reconciliation processChasing receipts is painful and slows down your team. Create a dedicated email for receipts and invoices (something simple like [email protected] will do), use this email when registering new subscriptions and add it to billing settings for existing subscriptions.If you use Xero for accounting you can throw out the receipts altogether with Airwallex Expenses. Submit, review and approve your employee card spend with a click and improve your accounting efficiency and accuracy. Single and multi-currency transactions will automatically flow into your chart of accounts for easy reconciliation.Save 3% on all USD software subscriptionsMany software companies that have a strong Australian presence charge in USD, like AWS, Atlassian, Hubspot and Slack. The Big Four banks charge a 3% foreign transaction fee each on all USD subscriptions and this can easily add up to thousands of dollars in fees each year.In good news, this can easily be avoided with Airwallex Borderless Cards. Simply issue virtual Visa debit cards to pay for your subscriptions in USD with zero transaction fees. You’ll also get access to our interbank FX rates and the ability to convert AUD to USD for just 0.3%. Does your business receive payments in USD? Make card payments directly from your USD funds via your Borderless Card to eliminate currency conversion fees.Keeping track of your ever-growing list of software subscriptions doesn’t need to be labour-intensive. Eliminate the hassle by deploying our Subscription Manager Google Sheet, Virtual Cards and a password solution to put your subscriptions on autopilot, all without breaking the bank.Click the purple button in the bottom-right of your screen to get the exact Software Subscription Management Google Sheet we use at Airwallex. We’ve also included some calculations so you can easily identify how much you would save by making the switch to Airwallex virtual cards for managing your software stack.Use virtual cards to provide additional security for subscription payments One of the biggest pain points of managing large tech stacks is lost or compromised card details – this can be a significant time sink for your team. With the growth of virtual cards, this can be easily avoided. At Airwallex, we use our  Virtual Debit Card product to help manage our subscription software. The beauty of virtual cards is that you can create one for each subscription - this means that you don’t have to update all your subscriptions if a card is compromised - you just need to update the card associated with the relevant subscription.Airwallex Virtual Cards can be easily blocked/unblocked using our online app – mitigate fraud without having to call your bank. You can also easily add daily and monthly spending limits to minimise risk.--Maintaining control of your ever-growing software stack doesn’t need to be a daunting task. By using Airwallex virtual cards, you not only save money on everyday business transactions but also streamline your expense management process and empower your team. If you’d like to speak to an Airwallex specialist to find out more about virtual cards and how to manage your software subscriptions, click here to book a demo.Related article: Xero Best Practices for eCommerce Businesses--Our products and services in Australia are provided by Airwallex Pty Ltd ABN 37 609 653 312 who holds AFSL 487221.

How Airwallex empowers your distributed teamsWe’ve written previously about tactics to help businesses quickly pivot to operate online and the benefits of working remotely. But as more and more businesses are harnessing the advantage of distributed teams, it seems like the right time to take a step back and evaluate your progress.If you’re of the mind that there’s always room for improvement, this is the article for you. Here are our top tips for managing your distributed teams more effectively that you may not have thought about.1. Over-communicate across all geographiesDistance can be a killer when it comes to distributed teams. We all crave human connection, so it can be an uncomfortable transition when we start working without this regular contact that we’re used to.No longer are we having conversations with our teammates on the way to the lift. We’re no longer having a quick chat while making a coffee, or calling informal meetings to confirm timeframes, just because we can. These small interactions can be the spaces where important information is transferred, so one big way to manage your distributed teams more effectively is by over-communication.Within reason, of course. We’re not saying you all need to share photos of your lunch everyday on the team Slack (once a week is enough), and we don’t mean bombarding teams with a running commentary of project updates.Over-communication can be as simple as creating a living company Google doc or Wiki that houses all your projects’ updates and their latest information. Keep it relevant, update it regularly, and keep it simple. Even something as obvious as noting when tasks have been closed out ensures everyone has the opportunity to be kept in the loop.Ensuring all staff are across these small decisions and actions replicates those short 10-second chats you otherwise would have in person. And this way, everyone is across the outcome. This can have a flow-on effect of teaching your teams to document all decisions, so you can always refer back to information, and will provide a thorough manual for new team members when they onboard.2. Make the most of your team ‘golden hours’Working in a distributed manner means that it’s much less common for your teams to be in the same place, at the same time, or even in the same time zone. Remote and distributed work has made it much more likely that your teams are working in entirely different regions, and as such, their daily office hours are less likely to overlap. But those times when every team member is at their workspace at the same time—wherever this may be—are known as ‘golden hours’. These are the times you want to make the most of, as a team. Have your daily start-up or Scrum meetings. Use this time to collaborate. Confirm the key things that your teams are working on, discuss where and how each team can help each other, and where necessary, organise handover so the team that’s just starting their working day can continue on with your projects.And if one team finds themselves having meetings at inconvenient times, consider rotating your meeting times so that this doesn’t become an ongoing issue.
3. Find the right balance between structure and time to get work doneOne thing that teams face when working in a distributed manner is the shift in their daily structure. Team meetings, Zoom calls, and online catch-ups are a great way of mimicking the structure of a ‘traditional’ working day. But while regular meetings like this are a good way to keep up the necessary human interaction, it’s also important to ensure your staff have the time to actually get their work done.A successfully distributed working structure needs some working space built into it. To do this, set purposes for your meetings, and stick to them. Team meetings are for your project teams to discuss the work at hand, your Scrum is where you’ll hear each other's' daily plans, and the weekly meeting can be a space to just check-in, talk through weekly highlights, and see each others’ faces.Plan these key meetings or events you need to achieve, but leave enough ‘free’ time for your teams to actually do the work that achieves your goals. 
4. Remove payment bottlenecks with virtual payment cardsWorking in distributed teams can often see your old processes go out the window. But your payments don’t have to be one of them.Setting up virtual debit cards within your teams can empower them to manage their budgets more effectively, without losing sync with your accounts team. Better still, they reduce time-consuming payment bottlenecks and gatekeeping, and make it easy for your teams to go about their business without requiring access from yourself or your accounts teams.And by dint of being managed online, virtual payment cards can be created in seconds, and your staff can start using them instantly. The ability to assign unique payment codes and payment limits means you can keep a better track of your spend while building improved accountability in your staff, wherever they’re located.5. Using a document first approachOne common complaint from the pre-distributed days was about meetings that could have been replaced with emails instead. Interestingly, that hasn’t changed. A document first approach embodies this, albeit in a more productive manner. A document first approach is exactly what it sounds like: you create a document first. This can take the form of a briefing document, or an overview, that outlines your new project, covers all the relevant pieces of information and includes space for input from the necessary parties.This allows for the key points of the meeting to be digested, clarified, and questions to be asked and answered, providing everyone involved the chance to all get on the same page, before a meeting is even called. Then, after you and your teams have taken some time away from the document, you can come back to it, finalise any outstanding questions and conversations, and where necessary call a meeting to align the project team.This method of working ensures everyone takes an active part in informing the meeting. They arrive at the meeting full-bottle on the project at hand, and you confine the scope of the meeting to only those points that need addressing. It’s a fantastically simple way to limit your meetings and reduce meeting fatigue. We go into a deeper dive on our document first approach here.
How Airwallex empowers your distributed teamsAirwallex Borderless Cards help you and your teams streamline your financials—wherever your distributed working finds you.These clever virtual cards are simple to create, and you can have them up and running in seconds.

Essentially, it’s your ability to plan for and effectively manage disruption to business as usual.A business continuity plan is your organisation’s formalised processes to manage these disruptive situations.Now, while these disruptions may include things like flood, fires, cyber attacks, or even global pandemics, your business continuity plan actually sits at a higher level than this. Instead of focusing on specific events, it provides the framework for your business to continue to operate as crises hit, and provides procedures you can follow to ensure your business is managed successfully during these times.
Why it’s important to have a business continuity plan in placeWhile it is possible to weather a crisis without a continuity plan, it’s going to be a difficult, uncomfortable experience, and you’ll feel like you’re flying blind.So by building a plan early, and reviewing it regularly, you’ll get peace of mind that should a crisis hit, you can deploy your plan and use it as your roadmap forward. It provides the clear framework for your business to follow that enables you to continue as close to business as usual as possible, even when things are decidedly not usual.
As such, it’s important that you have a business continuity plan in place before these issues occur. It’s important to remember that your business continuity plan is a framework. The plan itself provides the overarching structure for your response. How your business responds to specific disruptions can be detailed in individual incident response documents held within your plan.This can include planning for:Natural disasters such as storms, bushfires, or floodsGlobal pandemics (and at this point, we’ve all learned some valuable lessons on preparing for these types of crises)IT events such as cyber attacks, network failures, etcFinancial crises like the GFC, economic downturns, and recessionsIssues at any point along your supply chainHealth & safety, such as what to do in the event of workplace injury or illnessDoes my business need a continuity plan?Regardless of your business’ size, it’s sensible to have a plan in place for handling disruption.You likely have an IT recovery plan in place in case of data loss or cyber attack (and if you don’t, get on that immediately), but what about if an event occurs that puts half your management team out of action?Even as a small business, having a continuity plan in place empowers you to continue servicing your clients without the threat of shutting down.How to create a business continuity planCreating an effective business continuity plan will help you feel comfortable that your business has the ability to manage future crises to the best of your abilities. This isn’t to say it will be easy—but you will be as prepared as possible.At the outset this process can seem overwhelming. So it’s always best to start simple, and create your core content, then build out your plan from there. Here are the three key pillars you’ll need to create the core framework for your business continuity plan.
Plan for risksAlso known as a business impact analysis, this first building block allows you to map out your business-critical activities that must be protected at all costs.Start by outlining the critical business activities that need to occur in order for your business to continue. Then, identify any potential risks that your business faces that may impact these activities. By anticipating possible disruptions you’re able to plan how to manage them.Analyse the likelihood that these may happen. For example, IT issues are much more likely than a tornado.Evaluate the consequence of this disruption occurring. What will the impact be on your business? What will happen if your business stops performing a particular activity, and how long can it survive without it? Use this to rank the risks in priority order to determine a hierarchy of how and when to deal with them.Identify processes that help your business minimise these impacts, including the resources required to do so.Outline how you’ll respond to incidentsOnce you’ve outlined the risks and impacts of disruption on your business, you need to define how you’ll handle them.Start by identifying your crisis response team, those among your staff who will be needed when responding to an incident. Be sure to nominate who can take their place if they’re not available.Determine messaging and communication channels used during the crisis, including the timing of your communications. What will you say to your stakeholders? How often will you communicate with your staff and clients, and how will you do so?Create a contact list with all the necessary contact details for communication in these times. This includes your internal staff, their families, clients, suppliers, and even emergency service contacts. Depending on your communication channels, this can include phone number, address, email, Skype ID, or Twitter handle.Use the processes you created in your risk planning to formalise the actions you’ll take when specific disruptions occur. This is where you should go into detail, so you can make it as easy as possible for any reader to understand what to do in specific situations.The Victorian government provides a guide of what to think about when creating your incident response plan. You can check it out here.
Put steps in place for recovery once you’re out the other sideOnce the disruption has occurred and it’s been managed successfully (i.e. your business is still afloat and everyone is safe and healthy), it’s time to begin the recovery phase of your continuity plan.Your recovery plan outlines the steps to take to resume your business-critical activities, and the required timeframes, that will lead you back to business as usual—whatever that may look like. Determine the specific processes that will get your core business activities back online as quickly as possible.Identify the key resources and staff needed to complete these steps.Develop a checklist, or key indicators, to mark your recovery plan against, to ensure you’re on track.
These steps might look simple, but there’s a lot that goes into your recovery plan. For a better understanding of what you’ll need the Queensland government have created a thorough walkthrough to help you create a strong recovery plan.A business continuity plan helps you plan for the futureHaving a business continuity plan in place provides peace of mind that your business is protected against potential threats, and you’ll be able to safely manage your way through them.For an in-depth guide on how to create one for your business, the Australian government’s guideline When things don’t go to plan is a valuable resource for how to develop and build a complete continuity plan, and help you weather any crisis. It can be daunting to begin with, but by spending the time on your continuity plan now, you can take comfort knowing that your business has the flexibility to bounce back, whatever gets thrown at you.Back to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/EIN-from-outside-the-united-states,How to get an EIN from outside the United States,"BlogHow to get an EIN from outside the United States26 June 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What is an EIN?•Do I need one?•How much does an EIN cost?•How to get an EIN from outside the US•Do I need to pay taxes each year?•How do I pay taxes?•Airwallex makes paying your US taxes a breezeAs an Australian business owner, there are some business acronyms that we all innately know. ABN, TFN, ATO, GST; the list goes on.But if you’re looking to sell your products in the United States, there’s a whole new set of acronyms and business processes to learn and tax regulations that you need to get your head around.And before you can sell anything within the US, you’ll need to know about your EIN.What’s that, you ask? Let’s have a look.
What is an EIN?An EIN, or Employer Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit tax number that’s issued to businesses in the US by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It’s the identification number that your business uses when paying taxes.
Do I need one?If you have a business that’s registered within the US, that’s operating within the US, and you plan on paying taxes in the US (which as a US-registered business, you probably should) then yes, you will need an EIN. And if you import goods into the US, but you’re still registered outside the US, you’ll need an EIN as well.How much does an EIN cost?Much like an Australian tax file number or your ABN an EIN is a service that comes at no cost to you or your business. 
This is important to know, as if you’re considering setting up an EIN and you see websites charging to set one up for you, it’s best to avoid these. After all, you wouldn’t pay someone to set up your ABN for you, would you? Go directly to the IRS instead and set yours up for free.
How to get an EIN from outside the USAdmittedly, getting an EIN from outside the US isn’t as easy as we’d like it to be—but it’s not impossible. The issue for businesses outside the US is that your EIN can’t be lodged online. Online applications are only available to businesses whose principal locations are within the US. For international businesses, you’re going to have to make a phone call directly to the IRS. This can take a while, so it’s safest to set aside an hour of your time for this.Here’s how to do it.1. Head to the IRS website and fill out an SS-4 form, which is the application form for your Employer Identification Number. This goes through a series of questions about your business, including your address, business type, your employees, and similar, which will help you when answering questions later.2. If you’re authorising someone in the US to receive your EIN for you, you can fill out the Third Party Designee section of the SS-4. This means that they will receive your official EIN documentation once it’s prepared. If not, leave it blank. But be sure to provide your signature, otherwise, the application will be invalid and you’ll have to go through the process again.3. Make an international call to the IRS. But be aware that you’re making an international call, so you’ll be charged an international fee. You can reach them at:267-941-10996am - 11pm (Eastern Time)Monday through FridayListen to the phone menu and follow the prompts until you reach their EIN service. From here you’ll speak with a representative who will guide you through the EIN process. They’ll run you through a series of questions to fill out your information.Once you’ve answered all their questions satisfactorily you’ll then be issued with your EIN. You can start using this straight away.Be sure to take careful note of this number, as your physical EIN form is being mailed to you, so it may take a few weeks to arrive. Typically this will be sent to your registered US address, but if you don’t have one, make sure to ask if they can post internationally—or even if they can do it by email.And that’s it, you’ve got an EIN for your business. You can now start paying taxes in the US.
Do I need to pay taxes each year?In short, yes. When you run a business within the US, you’re required to pay taxes to the US government. Your EIN is what enables you to pay taxes in the US.In more detail, there are a few specific situations in which your business will need to pay taxes:You have employees, or your withhold taxes on income that’s paid to non-residentsYou operate as a corporation or a partnershipYou’re self-employed and have a tax-deferred pension (known as a Keogh plan)You’re in the finance, real estate, or the not-for-profit sectorYou file a tax return for: Tobacco, Firearms, Alcohol, Employment, or ExciseYou import goods into the US to sell on platforms like AmazonHow do I pay taxes?Unlike setting up your EIN, paying your taxes is actually quite straightforward. The IRS has an online tax portal, allowing you to pay your taxes online.Simply head to their portal, click the ‘Make Payment’ button, and follow the prompts.If you don’t have a US bank account you can pay by credit or debit card, however, this will incur associated international transfer and currency conversion fees.
Airwallex makes paying your US taxes a breezeYou shouldn’t be slugged with extra fees just for doing the right thing and paying your taxes.An Airwallex Foreign Currency Account lets you avoid any unnecessary conversion fees. All you need to do is set up a USD Global Account and you can neatly sidestep this process. You can effectively create a US bank account without the paperwork, the waiting times, and endless red tape. Simply set up your Global Account account with us and you can start sending and receiving USD immediately. You’re able to avoid any conversion fees and make same-day transfers, without any monthly fees. It’s the easy way to pay your US taxes from outside the United States.So if you’re looking for a better way to send and receive money in the US, or you want to know more about how we can support you in growing your business internationally, get in touch with us today for a free demo to see how Airwallex can help your business thrive.Related article: How to Open a US Stripe Account from AustraliaBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/best-time-to-use-virtual-payment-cards,When is the best time to use a virtual payment card?,"BlogWhen is the best time to use a virtual payment card?24 June 2020•4 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What are virtual payment cards?•So, is this an app?•When to use virtual payment cards•Software subscriptions•Single online purchases•Bookings and travel•Better business payments•Are virtual payment cards secure?•How do I get a virtual card?•There’s never been a better time to embrace virtual paymentsAs the world has shifted online, so have payment methods. One of the most innovative developments in recent years has been the rise of virtual payment cards.In this article, we look at how this exciting tech works, and what it means for your business.What are virtual payment cards?While reasonably new technology, virtual debit cards are taking off in a big way. They do exactly what their name suggests: these nifty online products act as debit or credit cards, but they’re entirely an online entity, with no physical card. You receive a generated 16-digit card number, complete with an expiry date and card verification number. This information is linked back to your account, and then works the same way as a traditional payment card: you can use it to spend money online through your suppliers but without the constraints of having a physical card.So, is this an app?While they work in a similar way, a virtual payment card is not a payment app.For starters, it’s not available in an app format. There’s no download required, and there’s no tap-and-go function like with Apple Pay and Google Pay. And unlike these platforms which can be used at brick-and-mortar stores, your virtual payment card is used almost exclusively online.The card data is generated online, and you use this to pay online. All you receive is the card number and the details, and you use this when it comes time to pay for goods or services.When to use virtual payment cardsYou can use a virtual payment card practically anywhere you would use your physical credit card. Software subscriptionsSoftware subscriptions are usually something you prefer to set and forget. You don’t want to be messing around remembering to make payments every month, or even every year. This is where virtual payment cards come in handy. You can create a virtual payment card that’s specifically for that software provider, with the card only going live during a certain date. This allows you to create a recurring payment at a certain time each month or year, depending on your billing cycle. You can also set the card to expire at a certain time, putting an automatic end date to your subscription. You can also set a payment cap on your virtual card, too, so the only spend available is for the same amount each period. This way, if your card details do somehow become compromised, the only amount of money at risk is what you’d usually pay for your subscription.
Single online purchasesWhat’s great about virtual payment cards is that you can create individual payment cards for one-off payments. Simply set the amount you need to pay, and then once the payment is made the card number becomes inactive, never to be used again. This makes them ideal for making large purchases, without the worry of having an extra payment card lying around.This provides you with the comfort and certainty that this money is only being used on what it’s intended for.One thing to be aware of here is if you need to make a return on that payment. Depending on where you make the purchase from, you may not be able to get a refund, as a one-off payment card is no longer valid. So keep this in mind when creating a one-time virtual payment card, just in case. Bookings and travelYou can assign specific merchant types to your virtual payment cards, which means that you can create payment cards specifically for travel, bookings, sundry funds, or the like. They can’t be used for any other spend types, so you always know where this budget is being spent. This makes them ideal for setting up travel or accommodation accounts for your staff. You can also set the currency, so if there’s international travel or purchases to be made, you can create a card specific to that currency, so you can make payments wherever you need to without getting slugged with expensive conversion fees.Better business paymentsYou can assign cards to specific team members or departments, which allows you to keep track of your budget and spend, and you know exactly where your staff are spending their money.Virtual payment cards even let you drill down to specific expense codes and departments, so when you make payments your information is translated immediately to your financial system. This enables you to eliminate the scramble of chasing down receipts or invoices, and streamline your reconciliations each month.Are virtual payment cards secure?One of the big benefits of a virtual payment card is the improved level of security you enjoy.At a basic level, a virtual payment card is just that—virtual—so there’s no physical card to lose, or to get stolen. You’re the only one receiving those card details, and as you’re able to set the time and spending limit for your cards, you can limit the potential for fraudulent payments too.You also receive improved accountability. A good virtual payment card system, such as Airwallex’s Borderless Cards, integrates seamlessly with your preferred financial platform, so your virtual card payment data is logged and tracked immediately. You can see exactly where your money is going, and when, without having to lift a finger.How do I get a virtual card?While many banks these days offer virtual payment cards, Airwallex Borderless Cards is an easier and smarter way to get started.Simply sign up to get started.  We’ll complete a quick identity check to confirm your details, then you’ll be able to issue new virtual payment cards instantly from your dashboard.

And if you’re collecting payments from international customers, you can end up getting slugged with a combined fee of up to 6.6%. It doesn’t sound like much on paper, but most e-commerce retailers only have profit margins of 10-20% so this is could be almost a third of your margin. Airwallex has a solution that lets you avoid unnecessary FX fees so you can keep more of your hard-earned profits or re-invest it more to grow your business. By connecting an Airwallex Global Account to your PayPal account, you can avoid certain charges and bring your total fee down by over 50%, in-turn supercharging your PayPal business account into a profit-generating machine.In this article, we’ll show you how you can achieve this, and what this means for you as a business.A breakdown of PayPal’s feesPayPal is quite open about its fees, and it’s spelled out clearly in their Product Disclosure Statement that they’ve designed them as a way to earn money from your currency conversions. For the Australian e-commerce retailer selling overseas into the US, you are most like going to be paying:A payment acceptance fee of 3.6% for every saleA FX conversion fee of 3.0% above their base FX rate if you want to convert back into AUD OR A withdrawal fee of 3.0% to withdraw your USD balance to your linked United States Bank Account
This combines to be a fee of 6.6% if you are selling in the US and then bring that money back into AUD
Improve your profit margins by eliminating unnecessary conversions with Airwallex Global AccountsWith an Airwallex Foreign Currency Account, you can integrate it seamlessly with your PayPal account, so you can withdraw your USD straight into your Airwallex account. 
This allows you to hold currency in USD, avoiding double conversion. Some retailers are converting their PayPal USD into AUD by withdrawing to an Australian bank account, then converting it back to USD when paying suppliers. This can add as much as another 4% FX fees on top of the 6.6% they were already paying when converting their USD into AUD. By withdrawing and holding USD in your Global Account, you can avoid this double conversion by using your USD directly to pay suppliers.The best thing about Airwallex Business Accounts is that they are completely free to set up online and incurs zero monthly fees. Save on international transaction fees with Airwallex Borderless CardsBut it doesn’t stop at Global Accounts. When you set up an account with Airwallex, you also get access to our Borderless Visa Cards. These cards can be set up in minutes, and you can start using them instantly. Simply load the desired currencies in your wallet and away you go. You’ll pay zero transaction fees on your purchases (which makes it perfect for international software subscriptions).Borderless Cards provide you with added security for your payments. You can add transaction and spend limits to these cards to reduce fraud risk and they can easily be blocked or deleted in our webapp if there are security concerns.  You’re able to assign individual cards to specific suppliers or vendors, so you always know exactly where your money is going and what it’s being spent on.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/epacket-shipping-ultimate-guide,The ultimate Guide to ePacket shipping to Australia,"BlogThe ultimate Guide to ePacket shipping to AustraliaJoe Romeo19 June 2020•6 minutesE-commerceIn this article•What is ePacket shipping?•How ePacket shipping works•What is ePacket Tracking?•What are the benefits of using ePacket tracking and shipping?•How long does ePacket take to deliver to Australia?•Customs and taxes for ePacket delivery•ePacket Countries•Airwallex makes e-commerce easyEstablishing ePacket shipping was an innovative response to the growing necessity for global shipping within the eCommerce industry. Online retailers and buyers needed a time-efficient delivery option to support the thriving eCommerce business, so ePacket helped regulate the shipping industry. 
Sellers from China and Hong Kong benefit most from the less expensive shipping option, and buyers appreciate the expedited shipping times. The ePacket shipping system has unified the world in terms of selling, shipping and delivering goods. 
But even with the novel technological advancements, eCommerce offered only one cost-effective way to ship internationally — and that was by organising huge, bulk orders in an attempt to get the most from expensive shipping costs. Once shipped, you then had to wait weeks, or even months, for your goods to arrive. Not an efficient system, to say the least.
Thankfully, this is no longer the case. The nature of eCommerce has had a direct impact on more efficient and effective shipping options around the world. Now, for smaller packages, ePacket shipping is an available option to improve shipping times and costs.
In this article, we explore what ePacket shipping is, how it works and its positive impacts on eCommerce businesses like yours.
What is ePacket shipping?
In response to the high-demand eCommerce industry, ePacket shipping was created to assist eCommerce businesses with international shipping logistics.
In 2011, as an alternative shipping option for small, less expensive items, ePacket shipping was intentionally designed as a bid to optimise logistics between China and the US.
Over the past decade, ePacket delivery has expanded to 44 countries — which means we’re now able to accept this advanced shipping method in Australia.
ePacket Australia
Particularly influencing businesses in Australia, ePacket shipping has established a more consistent and timely delivery option for eCommerce products. Despite Australia’s stern shipping restrictions, ePacket to Australia made international shipping to the country simpler. 
While shipping times can vary depending on the destination, on average, shipping takes 7–10 business days to reach another country. Specifically, Australia’s customs clearance processes can often delay deliveries for up to a month, but items usually arrive within 20 days. 
ePacket services provide multiple advantages: An innovative shipping alternative specifically designed to be a quick, cost-effective solution for smaller, lightweight packagesOnline tracking — typically reserved for larger items — so you can keep tabs on exactly where your product is in the supply chain An international shipping option on popular platforms like eBay and AliExpressFaster, more affordable delivery services with subsidised ePacket rates ePacket package dimension and weight restrictionsePacket delivery is designed for smaller parcels, so it comes with some strict guidelines.
Size - standardMin. length: 14cm
Min. width: 9cm
Max. length: 60cm
Max. total length + height + thickness: 90cm
Size - rolled packagesIf you’re sending a rolled package (things like cloth samples or posters), different dimensions apply.
Min. length: 11cm
Max. length: 90cm OR (diameter x 2) + length <104cm
WeightMax. weight: 2kg
Note that this includes the packaging itself, not just the item.
ValueThe total value of the goods within your ePacket cannot exceed AUD400.

How ePacket shipping worksWhen you choose ePacket delivery as your shipping method, there are a number of steps involved. ePacket delivery is effectively a term for the end-to-end process. When it ships, your parcel will be sent from the merchant directly. Your parcel will be shipped internally within China or Hong Kong by their local carrier, which then changes hands and is sent to Australia by an international carrier.When it arrives in Australia it’s then handled by a local carrier, in our case Australia Post.But what makes it really valuable is the tracking ability that comes with the ePacket service.What is ePacket Tracking?ePacket tracking is easy; every delivery comes with a free self-serve tracking number. This can be tracked using any country’s domestic mail carrier, in our case, it’s managed through Australia Post. This allows you to track and monitor, and eagerly await the arrival of your package throughout its entire journey, start to finish. This tracking method provides you with updates on estimated arrival times and works to reduce customer queries and questions to the merchant around delayed packages. Also, if your package is undeliverable, it gets returned to the sender free of charge. This makes it a no-risk option for merchants when a customer requests a refund for a lost parcel.How to track an ePacketTo track your ePacket, simply login to the Australia Post website, Worldwide Express Mail Service, or China Post website, and select the available tracking option. Then, input your ePacket tracking number to find out where your parcel is. You can also access third-party tracking tools if these sites aren’t working for you.What are the benefits of using ePacket tracking and shipping?ePacket shipping was created to meet the needs of eCommerce merchants. It’s ideal for smaller packages—which makes it perfect for dropshipping businesses. Here are some of the key benefits you’ll enjoy with ePacket tracking and delivery.It’s quickerWe’ve all been there. You order something online, and by the time it actually arrives it’s been so long that you forgot about it. ePacket shipping provides a faster delivery time, usually within 20 days. While this doesn’t match up to the platforms offering next-day delivery, three weeks for international postage isn’t bad.It’s cheaper ePacket shipping provides lower shipping rates than traditional shipping, so you’re able to offer better prices to your customers, which directly acts as an incentive. How many times have you gone to buy something online but the shipping turned you away?You can also use our free break-even analysis tool to help you analyse your business costs and improve margins.You get free returns on undeliverable packages It’s not your fault if your customer gives you an incorrect address, so you shouldn’t be penalised for it. ePacket delivery provides you with the security that any incorrectly-labelled items are returned, at no extra cost to you. This makes it a low-risk method of shipping, with the added bonus that you can provide a full refund to that customer, with no out-of-pocket expenses incurred on your end.You get end-to-end tracking You and your customers are able to see exactly where your package is at every step. No more waiting around wondering, simply log on to the Australia Post website and punch in the tracking number to see where it’s at.You get peace of mind With free returns, tracking, and a faster turnaround, one of the huge benefits of ePacket delivery is the peace of mind you get. You can buy something from a vendor, and you’re able to use the tracking to make sure they actually post it. No more worrying that you’ve been scammed, no wondering when, or even if, it will be posted. How long does ePacket take to deliver to Australia?ePacket shipping times normally takes up to 20 days to reach an address in Australia. However, expect delays around holidays and peak periods. Other countries may see similar or slightly longer shipping times, depending on transit routes.For those interested in the nitty-gritty, around half of this ‘shipping’ time is taken up by the different processing, handling, and customs steps. The travel portion is actually reasonably quick.Customs and taxes for ePacket deliveryAll goods arriving in Australia via post or mail are considered imported goods and get screened by the Australian Border Force. As such, your package will be assessed for:Community protection risksAny import or permit requirementsTaxes, duties, or other chargesAs your ePacket delivery is going to be under $400, you won’t have to pay any duties or taxes, as the threshold for this is $1,000 or over. GST will usually be charged when you pay for your items. The only instance where you will pay any charges on delivery is for alcohol.But to be sure, we recommend asking your vendor or merchant if they’re aware of any taxes or duties for sending to Australia.ePacket CountriesThere are currently 44 countries that support ePacket shipping, including:AustraliaAustriaBelgiumBrazilCanadaCroatiaDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGibraltarGreat BritainGreeceHong KongHungaryIrelandIsraelItalyJapanLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMalaysiaMaltaMexicoNetherlandsNew ZealandNorwayPolandPortugalRussiaSaudi ArabiaSingaporeSpainSouth KoreaSwedenSwitzerlandThailandTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomUnited StatesVietnamAirwallex makes e-commerce easyWhile Airwallex doesn’t have any specific affiliation with ePacket shipping, we are doing everything we can to simplify how you purchase products internationally and make it easy to boost your eCommerce business.

•What a retained earnings statement looks likeCreating a statement of your business’ retained earnings is a key step of your accounting process.But there’s more to it than a simple yearly check-box activity.In this article, we discuss what are retained earnings, why this matters, and how to prepare a statement of retained earnings using a retained earning formula.Let’s get started.What are retained earnings?In its simplest form, retained earnings demonstrate your business’ profit from the previous accounting year after all your obligations have been satisfied. They’re the funds that your business has generated that haven’t been distributed in dividends to your shareholders.Your retained earnings is money that your business is able to use for yourself. They can be utilised for reinvestment back into your business, into income-generating assets, or can be used to reduce your business’ liabilities.What is a statement of retained earnings?A statement of retained earnings is an important part of your accounting process. The statement is a document that you use to show your business’ income growth over time.Your retained earnings statement can be added as a line at the bottom of your business’ balance sheet. But it can also be prepared as its own standalone document, which has its own benefits.Why a statement of retained earnings is necessaryYour retained earnings statement is a necessary business document—and not just for general accounting purposes. It’s an important tool for startups and early growth businesses, which you can use to demonstrate to potential lenders and investors that your business is actively working towards your growth goals. This is why it can be beneficial to create a standalone document, which you can hand to interested parties without divulging any other financial information.Comparing historical retained earnings over your business’ history enables investors to predict future growth, potential dividend payments, and improvements on your business’ share price. It’s a defined document that demonstrates to investors and shareholders a solid return on investment.Your statement of retained earnings can be used to compare your business against others and prove that your business has legs. It shows that you’re able to make good on credit payments and settle your debt.Essentially, it acts as a road map to prove that your business has the potential to scale.
Why you need to demonstrate retained earningsRetained earnings are a useful tool to provide a link between your business’ income statement and your balance sheet. They’re recorded under your shareholder’s equity, which connects these two statements.But your retained earnings isn’t just a number. It’s a tangible, practical pool of money that can be used to pay for future business expenses. For example, it can be used to purchase new business assets such as machinery or equipment, funnelled into research and development, or used in other ways to promote growth for your businessRetained earnings are there to be used to help your business grow. If you don’t think you’re able to generate a reasonable return on investment for your retained earnings, businesses typically choose to distribute the earnings back to their shareholders as dividends.How to calculate retained earningsYour retained earnings balance is added to any net income or loss, and dividend payouts are subtracted on top of this. This paints a clear picture of your business’ income, and outlines any changes to these earnings for a specific period.There’s a simple retained earning formula you can use to calculate your retained earnings:
(Beginning period Retained Earnings) + (Your business’ net income OR loss) - (Cash dividends paid) - (Stock dividends paid)It works like this.Take the beginning period retained earnings, that is, those reported on your balance sheet from the previous year, which includes the current year’s income.Then, subtract any dividends you pay to your shareholders and any stocks.
You’ll then land in your current retained earnings, which in turn is used for the beginning period retained earnings for the next accounting year.How to prepare a statement of retained earnings in 5 easy steps
1. Create a headingThis covers three lines on your balance sheet. The first line must include your business name, and the second line should provide a succinct title for your document. The third line defines the year in which this statement is being lodged.
For example:My Exciting BusinessStatement of Retained EarningsFor the Financial Year Ended 20202. Record the balance of retained earnings from the previous yearThis is the first line item of your statement, also known as your beginning retained earnings.If you’ve prepared a statement in years prior this will carry over from the previous year. If it’s your first year doing this, your starting balance will be zero.Let’s start with an example of $500,000 as your previous year’s retained earnings.3. Add your net income additionThe second entry in your retained earnings statement is adding in the net income from your prepared income statement.For example, if your net income for the year was $100,000, you would add this to your retained earnings of $500,000.4. Subtract any dividend your company has paid to its shareholdersAny payment made by your company to its shareholders is considered a dividend. The sum of these payments is then subtracted from the net income for that year. If your company doesn’t pay any dividends, this amount is $0.For example, your company paid $50,000 to its shareholders. This is subtracted from the previous total figure of $600,000.5. Calculate the ending retained earningsOnce you’ve subtracted your company’s dividend payments from your net income, you will arrive at your ending retained earnings amount. This is the final entry in your retained earnings statement, which gets reported on your retained earnings account for the next accounting year’s balance sheet.To tie this example together, let’s look at it in total.Your previous year’s retained earnings were $500,000Add on your net income of $100,000Subtract your dividends of $50,000Therefore, your total retained earnings are $550,000This is the entry you will lodge for your statement of retained earnings.
What a retained earnings statement looks likePut together, here’s what your simple retained earnings statement may look like.Creating a retained earnings statement is easy, in theory. It just takes a solid understanding of your business’ incomings and outgoings, and a good brain for math.When drafting your retained earnings statement, how you do it is up to you. It can be as simple or as detailed as you’d like. If necessary, you can also provide additional information such as details of any stock purchases, or issues of stock.But it’s important to remember that this is also a sensitive document, so to make sure that you’re portraying the correct information, it’s always best to run these figures by your accountant first.Ready to scale your business with our business account?

The new offering will provide merchants global access to over 800 million Chinese consumers on WeChat Pay, enabling them to tap into a key Asian marketplace of active shoppers. WeChat is one of the largest social media platforms in the world with 1.2 billion monthly active users, and its pay function (WeChat Pay) allows its users to seamlessly make payments in their local currency for their purchases. WeChat Pay handles over one billion transactions globally daily, demonstrating the regular spending habits of its users. Airwallex’s WeChat Pay solution is designed to ensure smooth and fast flows of funds from buyers to the merchants.

Airwallex is currently working on additional features such as a data analytics tool which will provide important business insights on WeChat Pay payments to help merchants tailor their strategies, and boost their sales.Now available in Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, the new WeChat payment acceptance solution is a significant addition to the Airwallex product suite as the Group continues to build an end-to-end financial services product for digital businesses. With card payment acceptance also arriving this year, starting in Hong Kong, Airwallex’s customers will soon have multiple convenient methods to accept payments from anywhere in the world.Dave Stein, Airwallex’s Head of Corporate Development in Australia said, “We have seen e-commerce thrive during these unprecedented times. We believe this transition is here to stay even after the global lockdown ends, life normalises and shops reopen. As more merchants transition online, they require a wide range of payment acceptance options to remain relevant to different payment preferences around the world. With our new WeChat Pay solution, we are enabling merchants to adapt in today’s climate and also helping them open the doors to one of the largest and most active consumer markets in this world.” “Adding a payment acceptance solution to the Airwallex product portfolio is an important next step to enhancing our end-to-end financial services solutions.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-are-liquid-assets,What are liquid assets and why are they important?,"BlogWhat are liquid assets and why are they important?2 June 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What is liquidity?•What are liquid assets?•Cash assets•Non-cash liquid assets•What are non-liquid assets?•What are the benefits of liquid vs non-liquid assets?•Why liquid assets are important•Access cash fast with AirwallexIn this article, we'll look at the difference between liquid vs non-liquid assets, and what this means for your business. But first, let’s start at the beginning by defining what liquidity actually means. What is liquidity?‘Liquidity’ sounds like an obtuse term, but it’s actually quite descriptive.Liquidity is your business’ ability to convert your assets into cash, or how fluid your ability is to access the money that your business holds. Essentially, can you turn this flow of cash on and off like a tap? That’s liquidity.As a business, your money is typically held in your assets. So, to determine your business’ liquidity there are two types of assets to look at: liquid vs non-liquid assets.
What are liquid assets?A liquid asset is any type of asset your business holds that can quickly be converted to cash while still keeping its market value.There are certain factors that can make assets more or less liquid. These include:How long it takes for the asset to be soldHow established the market is for that assetHow easy it is for the ownership of the asset to be transferred
Within liquid assets, there are two main types of assets your business will typically hold.Cash assetsCash assets are any types of asset that involve actual currency.Cold, hard cash itself is one of the most liquid cash asset types available. This is because cash is available on-demand, it holds its market value well, and it can be transferred easily.Funds that can be withdrawn from your bank account are one of the next most liquid types of assets. These types of funds require no conversion. They’re quick, easy, and available to access practically immediately, at the press of a button.Your business’ accounts receivables are another good liquid asset. The money is yours, it’s designated to be transferred to you by your customers or suppliers—it’s just a matter of them paying on time.Non-cash liquid assetsNon-cash assets are those that aren’t as easily turned into cash. Investments are a great example of this. They’re considered cash equivalents, as they can be liquidated quickly if you need to access this money. Stocks are another good example of non-cash liquid assets. How easy they are to convert into cash depends on the nature of each stock, but on the whole, they’re usually available to access within a couple of days. The only issue is that if the market is down, you’ll sell your stock at a lower cost, meaning they don’t provide as good value for you.Long-term investments are less liquid. For example, dipping into your 401(k) wouldn’t be advisable (for many reasons, really), as anyone under 59 years of age faces steep early withdrawal penalties when trying to cash out.What are non-liquid assets?A non-liquid asset, or illiquid asset, is anything that can’t be quickly and easily converted into cash. These assets don’t just flow at the turn of a tap.Non-liquid assets are long-term investments. They have the purpose of helping your business build long-term wealth, rather than accessing quick money.Non-liquid assets include things like:Real estateVehicles and business equipmentArt, jewellery, and collectiblesOwnership in non-publicly-traded businessesWhen you need to access your non-liquid assets, this requires them to be sold, or have their ownership transferred, in order for you to access their value.This isn’t always an easy process. It can take anywhere from months to years to find the right buyer. Then, subsequent contract negotiations can draw out, going back and forth to reach an acceptable value. Once this is agreed upon, there’s still settlement and transfer time.What are the benefits of liquid vs non-liquid assets?The benefit of liquid assets is that they’re easy to access, and readily-available should your business need them. Also, they hold their value well. They’re not subject to volatile peaks and troughs like long-term assets, you’re able to access mostly the same value as what you expect.So if you need money within a short timeframe, liquid assets are where you should be looking to access these funds.Why liquid assets are importantLiquid assets exist to provide you with money when your business needs it. This includes being able to cover things like your regular supplier invoices, employee wages, insurance payments, and ongoing bills. But liquid assets are also invaluable in providing a safety buffer. If you need cash fast, whether it’s to make an important purchase or pay an unexpected bill, having a reserve of assets available as your emergency parachute can literally save your business.So the higher volume of liquid assets your business holds, the better prepared you are for operating with flexibility.Non-liquid assets certainly do have their place and are necessary to help your business build long-term wealth. But liquid assets are critical in running an agile business.Having a higher volume of liquid assets is also beneficial when applying for loans. This demonstrates more cash available, so you’re a safer loan candidate, and you may even find yourself able to access more competitive interest rates and better loan terms. This is crucial for startups and new businesses.Access cash fast with AirwallexIn the current climate, liquid assets are critical in helping businesses survive through our unprecedented financial situation. But the key is balancing available cash reserves with strong financial security.Airwallex is designed to help businesses like yours access, send, receive, and transfer cash as quickly and effectively as possible, all around the globe. With same-day transfers and real-time payouts, you’re able to release money instantly, either to your business or suppliers, when you need it. Airwallex Business Account also makes it easier to manage your accounting and payroll, reducing your margin for error, so you always pay your bills on time. Integrating seamlessly into your existing financial system, Airwallex allows you to ensure your employee wages and supplier payments always go through on time, and you’re never charged any interest or late fees. We enable you to minimize your transaction costs and keep more money in your account, so you can remain as liquid as possible—even in these turbulent times.Related article: The Best D2C Platforms for International eCommerceOur products and services in Australia are provided by Airwallex Pty Ltd ABN 37 609 653 312 who holds AFSL 487221.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/constant-product-innovation-is-critical-to-finding-market-fit,Constant product innovation is critical to finding market fit,"BlogConstant product innovation is critical to finding market fit29 May 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•1. Find a large problem space•2. Conduct user research to ensure that your product fits this problem space•3. Hire the right team to build a great product Written by Jack Zhang, CEO and Co-founder of AirwallexThe significant impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on businesses worldwide is undeniable. Businesses in every industry have been forced to reinvent the way they operate, communicate and serve their customers. As the dust begins to settle and restrictions start to ease in certain parts of the world, we are emerging from the wake of the crisis more aware of the need for innovation. Businesses spend years perfecting product-market fit, and those who get it right end up with a great product that solves a problem, or fulfils a need or desire for a large enough segment to make a business viable.Attaining product-market fit is one thing, sustaining it is a completely different matter. Product-market fit is not a milestone to reach or a goal to tick off; rather, it is a continuous cycle of growth. Finding it in the early days is key, but recent disruptions and global shifts have shown us that evolving product-market fit for new opportunities that come our way is equally important.
I recently had the wonderful opportunity to speak to Judy Anderson, CEO of Startup Victoria, for a retrospective session where I looked back on the lessons learnt from our unique journey of finding product-market fit at Airwallex – I’ve outlined some of them here.
1. Find a large problem spaceThink of the problem as a space where customers' needs, challenges or desires live – where the product you are delivering will fulfil those requirements. The larger the problem space, the larger the opportunity. There is limited scope if the problem space applies to only a small segment of people or a single market. Identifying a problem space that you can solve in more markets allows you to be relevant internationally – beyond the shores of Australia lie massive markets in the US, UK, Europe and Asia. For example, the Australian economy makes up less than 2% of the world economy. Expanding into the US, UK and EU will provide access to over 30% of the world’s economy, and approximately 40% when you include China, which is a significant increase in addressable market size compared to Australia alone. Under the current volatile circumstances, it is more important now than ever to tap into the global economy and the opportunities it brings for business growth.
2. Conduct user research to ensure that your product fits this problem spaceWhen I started Airwallex with my co-founders, we didn’t get it right straight away. The idea behind Airwallex was inspired by some of our experiences running a small business. Based on some of the challenges we faced as small business owners, we created a product that we assumed many other Australian small businesses required as well. Preliminary research was done to prove the need for the product, however, our research wasn’t comprehensive enough to really understand the biggest pain points that SMEs were facing at the moment to capture the majority of the market. It was then that we decided to buckle down on extensive user research – listening to feedback and pain points from existing and potential customers to help us redesign our product. The problem space we were in then suddenly widened as we pivoted from a niche product, exclusively targeted at Australian SMEs, to one delivering a solution that many global businesses truly needed and wanted. Today, user research and data continues to inform our decision making across all aspects of the business.Product-market fit is a continuously evolving process. Constantly engage with your customers to get a sense of their priorities – what they need today may change tomorrow, as we’ve recently seen happen with the current pandemic. At Airwallex, we make it a priority for the management team to speak to our customers directly and not always rely on feedback from the sales team. We want our customers to know that communication channels – a phone call, an email, a meeting (virtual for now) – with the key decision-makers are always open. Through these channels, we get honest and unfiltered insights that are invaluable when building our product features.3. Hire the right team to build a great product Product and engineering are critical roles for any technology-driven business. I’ve spoken about the importance of finding the right problem space, the need for regular customer engagement, but all of that effort will be for naught without a great product. Product and engineering teams greatly influence every aspect of a product’s success, so it is important to ensure that you have the best talent possible. Recruitment was a challenge for us in our early days. As we didn’t start out with a dedicated HR team, my founders and I scoured our personal networks for our initial product and engineering hires. For a CEO, or any other senior leader for that matter, it is not practical to devote the time and energy needed to source and secure this type of talent while delivering on the demands of your day role. We ended up compromising on the quality of talent we brought onboard, which proved to be a huge mistake. Any founder will tell you that hiring the wrong people will set you back, as it did for us. An inefficient product built on bad code in the first couple of years was hard to undo.Thankfully, once we introduced a dedicated recruitment team (after two years without one), more stringent interview processes and a higher standard of talent quality, a solid product and engineering foundation soon followed. In the last two months we have added two stellar product directors to the Melbourne team – Richard Jeremiah and Shannon Scott. They have already had a huge impact on the team with their unique skills and experience. A great team with great talent makes all the difference. --In a world where change is the only constant, we must adapt to ensure the sustainability of ourselves. That goes for any human, and for any business. As customer behaviour shifts and e-commerce continues to rise and become more prevalent, listen to your customers and continually innovate your product until you find product-market fit, so that you can rebuild your business and start seeing growth again.Related article: A message from our Co-founder and CEOBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-is-the-interbank-exchange-rate,Understanding the interbank exchange rate,"BlogUnderstanding the interbank exchange rate26 May 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What is the interbank exchange rate?•Can my business access the interbank exchange rate?•The difference between bid and ask prices•Hidden fees that increase the exchange rate•Airwallex gets you the best exchange rate possibleThe foreign exchange market is a vast and nebulous one. In fact, it’s the largest market in the world.As a growing business, you’ll likely be dealing with international suppliers and clients, which means you’ll need to make foreign currency exchanges. So you want to make sure you’re getting the best FX rate you can.But when you start to do your research to find the best money transfer provider, things can get confusing. Bank to bank, supplier to supplier, the exchange rate can differ wildly. Then, when you do a quick Google search, the FX rate changes yet again.Understanding what the interbank exchange rate is, and how this impacts your FX rate, ensures you’re prepared when it comes to foreign currency exchange. It enables you to be aware, alert and armed with the knowledge to get the best rate available to you.What is the interbank exchange rate?In its simplest form, the interbank exchange rate is exactly what it says it is: it’s the exchange rate that banks use when trading foreign currency between each other.It’s determined by the banks accessing and analysing live currency exchange rates. They then take a mid-point between the buy and sell rates of each currency and use this as their exchange rate.You might also see it referenced as the ‘real’ exchange rate, the mid-market rate, or the spot rate.The spanner in the works is that there’s no single, agreed-upon interbank exchange rate. The rate changes depending on the bank, the currency, the market—even the time of day.When you do a Google search to find the foreign exchange rate for a particular currency or check exchange calculation services, this is typically the rate you will see.It sounds simple, doesn’t it?Can my business access the interbank exchange rate?If only it was as simple as that, though. As a business, you typically won’t receive the interbank exchange rate when exchanging currency. You will usually get a blended rate, taken as a mix of live exchange rates, market data sources, and the differences between banks.Banks will usually mark up the interbank rate by anywhere from 4% to 6%. It doesn’t sound like much, but these small percentages add up, particularly when you’re dealing with large amounts of money.After all, foreign transfer providers and banks are businesses too, so they will add a little increase on the exchange rate as a way to pay staff, to pay for the time taken to make the currency exchange, and as a way to boost their profits.The difference between bid and ask pricesWhen looking at foreign currency exchange you’ll come across the terms bid price and ask price.These are simply different ways of saying the buy and sell prices. Banks sell currency for the ask price, and they buy currency at the bid price.These prices will usually differ. This can be affected by anything from the current political climate, world news, inflation and interest, to simple supply and demand.The difference between these two prices is known as the bid-ask spread and is something you need to know about when exchanging foreign currency, as this determines where you’re getting the best deal on currency exchange.Currencies in reasonably developed nations typically have a low spread. In emerging markets the bid-ask spread can be much larger, and change greatly throughout the day.Hidden fees that increase the exchange rateBrokers are known to charge a markup on the bid-ask spread, where they buy your currency and sell it for a marked up price. Brokers charge this markup as a way to make money off your foreign currency exchange.Again, it’s usually only a small percentage; you may not even notice when you see it written on paper. But when exchanging large volumes of currency regularly, these small percentages add up and affect your bottom line. Say you’re exchanging $100,000. A 1% markup makes the difference of $1,000. If you do this multiple times a year, or a month—or even week—that’s a lot of money you’re actively losing.So it’s important to get the best exchange rate.Airwallex gets you the best exchange rate possibleAirwallex takes the headache out of navigating foreign currency exchange. We enable businesses to get the closest possible rate to the interbank exchange rate. When you exchange foreign currency with us, you can access our interbank FX rate, with a very small and transparent margin on top.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-get-the-best-foreign-exchange-rate,How do I get the best foreign exchange rate?,"BlogHow do I get the best foreign exchange rate?21 May 2020•4 minutesFinanceIn this article•Foreign exchange provider research is key•Do your due diligence•Don’t get confused•Look at the total cost•Beware the banks•Order online•Pay in the local currency•Lock in rates when they’re favourable•Airwallex gets you the best exchange rate, every timeFor businesses, getting a good foreign exchange rate can make a huge difference in your bottom line.But how do you get the best exchange rate?The issue is that there’s no one set global FX rate. Prices change all the time, and different suppliers have different rates. Even small variations can have a big difference in how much money you keep in your pocket or receive.Here’s how we recommend you go about getting the best FX rate.
Foreign exchange provider research is keyIt might take some time, but it all starts with shopping around to find which provider has the best exchange rate.But be careful when looking into foreign exchange services, or what the banks are offering, as these suppliers won’t typically offer the real exchange rate. The rate you see has an added mark-up on the real exchange rate to make the transaction more profitable for them, so they can keep more of your money in their coffers.Do your due diligenceForewarned is forearmed, and doing your own research means you know what to expect as an acceptable foreign exchange rate. This doesn’t have to take up much time, either.Before you start looking around at different foreign exchange options, do a quick internet search to find the current mid-market exchange rate. This is a pretty good indication of what the banks are charging each other, which you can then compare against any offered FX rate and see if you’re getting a fair deal.Don’t get confusedSmaller businesses and first-time users may get confused by the different rates available when you’re looking to exchange currency.There are different terms for different exchange rates—such as the spot rate, money rate, or forex rate—and a particular rate on one of these doesn’t necessarily translate into the exchange rate you’re receiving.The rate to pay attention to is the interbank exchange rate. Also known as the mid-market rate, this is the globally accepted exchange rate, at that moment, which is used by banks when they exchange currency.
Look at the total costThe exchange rate is just one piece of the puzzle when trying to find the best FX rate. While the supplier may advertise low rates, other fees can come into it which make their seemingly competitive exchange rate cost you more in the long run. Things like commissions, foreign exchange fees, and card fees may not be advertised as part of the total cost. Some things to be aware of are:Commission prices. Be sure to ask around to see what commissions are being chargedZero fees or commissions. This usually means they’ve marked up the real exchange rate considerably to make up for it
Beware the banksWe said this before, but it’s such an important point that it deserves its own section, just to reiterate.Banks will usually have the highest foreign exchange rates when compared to other providers. This is because banks are, typically, trustworthy. People use them because they’re a known and respected institution, and we’re likely to just wear higher exchange rates as part of their service.But it doesn’t have to be this way. For example, check out the difference in foreign exchange rates between Airwallex and the Big 4 banks.Order onlineFor some businesses, instead of going through the process of exchanging foreign currency, you can simply order online. Ordering online allows you more chance to purchase and pay via card, or in your suppliers’ currency. This allows you to reduce any extra fees, leaving you only out of pocket for the foreign exchange fee charged by your card’s supplier.
Pay in the local currencyBetter than paying online, simply pay your supplier in their local currency. This way you avoid the need to exchange currency and avoid any foreign exchange fees. An Airwallex Foreign Currency Account allows you to send, receive, and hold money in specific currencies, with no exchange necessary—avoiding the banks altogether.Lock in rates when they’re favourableWhile FX rates change minute by minute, some suppliers allow you to lock in FX rates when they’re favourable.
With Airwallex, you can lock in a current FX rate for a set period of time, giving you certainty around your transactions.

Tell your customers and promote your new e-commerce business•8. Unveil your new site and online shopfront•Airwallex helps your business make the shift online with Global AccountsIn today’s society, consumers expect a business to have an online presence. A functional, friendly website adds familiarity and credibility to your brand. But a website is only one part of the puzzle. Shifting your products online not only provides an extra avenue to make sales, but also helps your business maintain flexibility during crises.And it doesn’t have to be hard. Here’s how to shift your products online in 8 easy steps.
1. Choose a content management systemThe right CMS makes all the difference in how easy it is to set up your online store. We recommend Shopify. It’s easy to set up, intuitive to customise, and provides you with a generous free trial to make sure the platform is right for you. 
Once you’ve signed up, you then choose your payment plan and link your domain name to Shopify’s name servers. Most modern domain registrars have a native connection with Shopify, so just follow the instructions they provide you.2. Choose a store themeYour business probably already has a certain look and feel, so it’s important that you choose a theme that matches. Shopify has plenty of free themes available which give you a quick and easy way to get started when time is of the essence. These themes are usually able to be customised, so find the one that suits and then tweak it until it’s just right.3. Focus on your most important pages firstNow that you’ve got the space, it’s time to start fleshing out your online store.Start with the important information first: what do your customers need to help them through the shopping process? We recommend starting with these core pages, and expanding from there:Home page. Your homepage is essentially your online shop front, so treat it like your brick and mortar space. Keep it clean, make it easy to navigate, and have the critical information on there that your customers need to know in order to buy from you.Shipping information. Your customers will want to know how your new service works, and when they’ll receive their products. Providing thorough shipping information lets them know exactly how your new business works, and what they can expect. It also saves you time on the phone answering questions.Contact us. Your customers also want to know how to get in touch with you—so make it easy for them. Provide all the contact details they need to talk, call, email, and find your physical shop. Give them an avenue to contact you to discuss product issues or returns.Your key products. Providing clear, accurate product information makes it easy for your customers to buy, but making it exciting and engaging is what compels them to do so. Write your product descriptions and shop content so that it matches your business’ personality.
4. Upload productsNow it’s time to get your products on your website. If you’ve got a large product range this might take some time, so check with your CMS provider on the best way to do this. You might be able to upload in bulk via .csv or similar, as opposed to dragging it out uploading each product one-by-one.5. Set up your shipping optionsYour customers want to buy online because they don’t have the time or aren’t able to come to your shop in person—so make it worth their while. A good way to do this is to focus on keeping your shipping costs down. Here’s how:Keep it simpleYou can do this by doing the packing and shipping yourself, rather than outsourcing to a third party. By printing your own labels and packing your parcels yourself, you’re able to keep these costs to a minimum. If you’re not worried about fancy, stylised packaging, you can get packing materials in bulk from Officeworks or Australia Post, to keep your costs down further.Go localAlso, consider offering a local delivery option. This way your closest customers—the ones who are literally around the corner—won’t feel alienated. This could be as simple as offering free local delivery within a five-kilometre radius or having your staff assist with local product deliveries. It’s also a great way to keep your staff employed during a shutdown.
6. Set up your payment platformNow comes the important part: enabling payments for your site. Are your customers able to pay by credit card? Do you accept bank transfers? Or will you enable a third party system like PayPal, Apple Pay, or Airwallex?When you choose a payment method and provider, make sure it’s relevant to where your customers are located. Shopify has a handy payment gateway list where you can check which payment methods and currencies are available in your country.
Airwallex lets you think globallyFor fast, cost-effective payments, Airwallex Foreign Currency Accounts enables you to receive funds from over 10 currencies, and convert or withdraw this money into your preferred currency. There are no transaction fees and a foreign exchange rate that’s up to 90% cheaper than the big banks. Global Accounts can be set as the default bank account for your online store so you receive payments with minimal fuss. We make your accounting easy, too, as you can seamlessly integrate your Airwallex account with Xero for easy payment reconciliation.7. Tell your customers and promote your new e-commerce businessNow that your online store is in progress, it’s time to let your customers know you’re setting up for business.If you’ve already built an email database, send out an e-newsletter to your network letting them know of the changes. Make sure you do this before your online store opens, so they’re prepared for the shift—and also to build up suspense for the grand opening. Include a quick guide on how they can now purchase from you online, so they know exactly how it works.Promoting your online store through your social media channels is a high-impact, low-cost way to reach more customers.You can also update your online listings so your shop information is correct. Update your details in Google My Business to include your new website URL so it appears in your Google Maps listing.But don’t confine your efforts to the online world. Let the real world know, too. Put up signs in your physical storefront to let your customers know the exciting news, and think about creating some flyers to hand out at the checkout.
8. Unveil your new site and online shopfrontNow that your online store is set up, it’s time to bring in the customer traffic.Announce a grand e-opening of your store, invite your customers to browse and buy. You may even consider running discounts and specials to further entice them in. After all, you’ve worked hard to shift your products online—so now it’s time to have some fun, and enjoy the fruits of your e-labour.Airwallex helps your business make the shift online with Global AccountsAirwallex makes it easy to set your business up for e-commerce success with our Business Accounts. You can get your account set up within the day, and you can start sending and receiving payments online immediately.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-invoice-eu-customers-as-a-uk-business,How to invoice EU customers as a UK Business,"BlogHow to invoice EU customers as a UK Business13 May 2020•4 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•A note about Brexit•Confirm the company is part of the EU•Set a defined invoice currency•Charging VAT•Registered for VAT and selling goods•Not registered for VAT?•Information required on your invoice•Issuing your invoice•Keeping your invoices•How to get paid•Avoid bad exchange rates with Airwallex Euro Global Account•Airwallex makes it easier to invoice EU companiesAs a business supplying goods or services, or receiving payments on one of your accounts, EU regulations require you to issue an invoice. We compiled this step-by-step guide that enables you to easily and successfully invoice your EU customers as a UK business.A note about BrexitAs part of the UK’s Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, we’re set to remain within the EU VAT regime until 31 December 2020, and there won’t be any changes to the UK VAT rules during this time. This article talks about the current arrangements. Here’s how to do it.Confirm the company is part of the EUIt sounds obvious, but make sure to confirm that the country you’re sending the invoice to is actually part of the EU.Set a defined invoice currencyTo avoid invoice confusion, speak with your customer to agree on a specific invoice currency. You’ll generally be able to invoice in EUR, however, some EU countries use their own currency. On your invoice, the tax must be shown in GBP.Charging VATYour VAT requirements will change depending on the type of business you run. Businesses providing services to other companies aren’t required to charge VAT, they simply pay this in their country of residence.
Registered for VAT and selling goodsArticle 138 of the EU VAT Directive means that sales of goods to EU member states are exempt from VAT, so you can simply state the VAT value as zero on your invoices. There are a few exceptions to this rule, including transport services and purchasing second-hand goods, so it’s best to check with your qualified VAT accountant to confirm your requirements.Not registered for VAT?Businesses not registered for VAT shouldn’t charge VAT. As well as causing confusion, you may also find your business receiving a penalty of anywhere from 10%-100% of the VAT shown on the invoice.
Information required on your invoiceThere are a number of things that you should include on your invoice to EU companies.Issue date of the invoiceA unique invoice identification numberYour company’s full name, registered address, and company registration numberYour customer’s full name, address, and registration numberA brief description of the goods or services suppliedThe quantity of the goods you supplied or services you rendered to the companyThe date you supplied the goods or servicesThe place where the goods or services were suppliedThe total amount payableIf your business is registered for VAT, you also need to include:Your VAT numberYour customer’s VAT numberThe VAT rate chargedThe taxable amount per rateThe total VAT payableIf your invoice is in a different currency, the equivalent VAT in GBPIf you’re providing a service, then the other party pays VAT, not you. Instead you need to state “Article 44 of the EU VAT Directive; VAT is due by the recipient of the service”If delivering VAT-exempt goods, you need to state “ VAT exempt, EC Supply Article 138 of the EU VAT Directive”Outside of this information, you can add in any other information that’s agreed upon by you and your client. This can include things like a purchase order number, or contact details for queries or customer support.Issuing your invoiceInvoices should be issued within 30 days of the taxable supply, and it’s best to confirm with your client whether you’re sending an electronic invoice or hard copy. 
When it comes to customers with large accounts, you may choose to send a summary invoice if you prefer, as long as you issue these monthly. Debit and credit notes follow these rules too.Keeping your invoicesFor both UK tax and VAT purposes, it’s important to keep both sales and purchase invoices for your EU companies for at least six years.
If you’re a VAT MOSS business—VAT Mini One Stop Shop, a type of service for business that sells digital services to EU consumers—you should keep your records for ten years.
It’s not important where you file your invoices, just as long as you have them. But it’s best to store them somewhere easily accessible, and ensure that their integrity and readability remains intact. HMRC is able to visit your business whenever they wish to ensure your records are in order, so it’s best to keep them together at your business premises, or via cloud storage.
How to get paidHow you ask to get paid is up to you and your client. Asking to be paid in GBP means there will be no exchange risks on your end. Invoicing in your client’s currency requires an exchange into GBP, for which your bank will typically charge an exchange fee. It’s important to note that banks usually charge a set exchange fee, and have a poorer exchange rate than the actual rate, meaning they make more money off your transfers.Avoid bad exchange rates with Airwallex Euro Global AccountAn Airwallex Euro Global Account enables you to open a foreign currency account specifically for EUR payments. When you set up your account, you’re issued with your own European IBAN, which you can add to your invoices and you can begin accepting payments in EUR immediately, through direct bank transfer. This means that your money is being transferred through local banking networks, and you should receive it faster, usually same-day.Unlike other transfer methods, with an Airwallex EUR global account, there is no set-up fee, zero monthly fees, access to the real interbank exchange rate.Then, you can withdraw your EUR into GBP immediately, using the real conversion rate.Airwallex makes it easier to invoice EU companiesSetting up an Airwallex Euro Global Account is a smarter, more profitable way to send invoices to your EU clients and suppliers. It’s easy to get started, and you get competitive exchange rates you won’t find anywhere else. Simply, it’s a better way to do business with your EU companies.It’s like we never left.So sign up today to discover how Airwallex streamlines your global payments.Related article: IBAN Discrimination: What is it and what are my options?Our products and services in Australia are provided by Airwallex Pty Ltd ABN 37 609 653 312 who holds AFSL 487221.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-an-international-money-transfer-provider,What to look for in an international money transfer provider,"BlogWhat to look for in an international money transfer provider13 May 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•Fees•Speed of transactions•Security•True international reach•Any additional features•Airwallex makes international money transfers easyWhen it comes to looking for a new international money transfer provider it pays to shop around. There’s a balance between trust and value that you need to take into account, and just going with a name you know doesn’t necessarily guarantee the best service.
We’ve created a quick guide to help you when searching for a new provider. This should help you review and compare the different international money transfer providers available on the market, and get you thinking about which is best suited to your needs.Here’s what you should be looking for:FeesWhen looking for an international money transfer provider, their openness and transparency can go a long way to positioning them as your top choice, particularly when it comes to fees. 
FX fees. How does the provider charge their FX fees? While there is no concrete interbank exchange rate, some providers do put a markup on their FX rate. It might not seem like much, but every increase in their FX rate means you’re charged more per transaction, and they pocket more of this fee.Transaction fees. If you’re making a high volume of transactions, even small transaction fees start to add up. If the fee is a percentage this can become particularly costly when you’re making larger international transactions. Look for a company that offers either a small, flat fee, or no fees at all.Administration fees. Make sure to check any regular admin or management fees for each provider. Some may add on sign-up costs, account management, and other fees, that won’t always be explicitly stated when looking at their fee structure.Speed of transactionsSpeed is everything when you’re transferring money. These days, people expect things instantly—and international payments are no exception.Look for a provider that offers quick transfers. Where banks can offer a typical 1-5 business day transfer, you’ll be able to find providers who provide same-day transfer, regardless of your geographical distance.And when it comes to speed, the sign-up process needs to be easy, too. Look for a provider that offers clear and concise online sign-up, and doesn’t require you to submit page after page of financial information just to start using their service.SecurityYou’re sending money internationally, so you want peace of mind that your platform is secure. It should go without saying, but check with your provider first to see how stringent their security protocols are. 
Confirm that you’re always able to access your funds and that they’re never invested or lent to third parties. Do their security procedures comply with international standards? PCI Level 1 is the highest international standard, so this is a good indication that your funds will be secure.Check their registrations. Look for a provider who is registered in Australia with AUSTRAC and regulated by ASIC under an Australian Financial Services License.When it comes to your data, two-factor authentication should be the standard, to ensure you’re kept abreast of any attempts to access your account.True international reachWith the growing global market, it’s likely you’ll be needing to interact outside of the typical US dollar or Euro market. So when choosing an international money transfer provider, confirm how many currencies they support. It’s also important to find out how many countries they’re connected to. You want to ensure you have the capability to actually send money to the country you need, prior to signing up.Any additional featuresAdditional features aren’t just the cherry on top: they’re what can make the difference between a standard international money transfer provider, and a long-term business partner. After all, your provider exists to make your life easier, so the more value they can offer you, the better.Look into features that extend beyond purely transferring money. Look at features like:Virtual payment cards. Virtual payment cards act in the same way debit or credit cards do but without the need for a physical card. They’re ideal for controlling spend online in a safe and controlled manner and can be a useful resource for regular international spend.International currency accounts. A foreign currency account can enable you to send, receive, and store international currency, all from one account—just as though you opened a bank account in that country.Platform versatility. A cloud-based platform is fantastic as you’re able to access your money wherever you go. But for serious banking, sometimes this isn’t enough. Check to see if your provider’s software is able to sync with external platforms, and how you’re able to integrate it into your business’ workflow.Airwallex makes international money transfers easyWe’ve streamlined the way that businesses send and receive your money online.With Airwallex, businesses can:Create a business account, and get up and running on the same day.Get limitless same-day international money transfers, whenever you need them.Save on FX with low, transparent pricing. You pay a minuscule 0.3% or 0.6% margin on top of the interbank transfer rate—far better than you receive from the big banks.Open business accounts in up to 23 currencies, with zero monthly fees.Simplify your purchasing and accounting, by integrating your payments with global online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Shopify, and PayPal, or directly to your Xero account.Empower your staff to take responsibility for their international budgets with Airwallex Borderless Cards.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/funding-options-available-to-businesses-now,Funding options available to businesses now,"BlogFunding options available to businesses now12 May 2020•5 minutesFinanceIn this article•Venture Capital and Angel Investment•R&D Finance•Revenue-based funding•
Crowdfunding•Conclusion
Starting and growing a business is a challenge in any economy, but in a global lockdown, ensuring cash flow is even harder than usual. Money, as always, does make the world go around, especially for businesses looking to scale. Even in these troubling times, there are still many forms of available funding. In this post, we've rounded up the most important funding options, so you can make sure you're maximising all available financing for your company. Governments around the world have made new funding options available to businesses struggling through the pandemic. Packages differ across regions, but most governments have implemented support packages either in the form of cash injections, assistance with payment for salaried employees, or at the very least, tax holidays and relaxed payment terms. As the terms of eligibility and the type of program vary from region to region, most companies turn to government websites as the first port of call. However, this might not provide the full picture, as financial aid is given both at a national and local level by different authorities. It is recommended for a company to check both the website of the national tax authority, like the ATO in Australia or HMRC in the UK and the websites for your regional administration, for example, the website of the local government of New South Wales in Australia.  Venture Capital and Angel InvestmentIn the first weeks of the pandemic, a wave of panic hit equity deals all over the world. Many VC and Angel-funded deals were suspended or postponed indefinitely, and it seemed like a bleak time for anyone trying to woo investors. Things have changed quite a bit since then, and equity is starting to thaw across the board from seed to series C and beyond. 
While some investors are still hesitant to jump back into the water, some are excited more than ever by the opportunities this brings. Wilson Casado, an angel investor in Perth: ""As an investor, I personally think that this is a great time to fund startups. These companies will allow ‘ setbacks to be turned into springboards’, and such opportunities are worth investing in. The sector will also play a key role in creating new jobs, which will be critical in the recovery phase."" If you're seeking investment, it is a great time to engage with VCs and Angels, as COVID-19 has opened up channels of communication that were dormant up to now. Most venture capitalists are active online, looking for solutions, and many have offered to help and advise entrepreneurs and companies struggling through the lockdown. And don't forget the old silicon valley adage: ""Ask for money and get advice, ask for advice and get money"" – it could apply even more in a world much more interconnected through online means. R&D FinanceR&D finance is an easy way to make use of the funding you've already invested to fuel your company's growth. Many countries in the world run R&D incentive programs, and this means that the government can refund a certain percentage of a company's investment in R&D as either a tax credit or a tax offset. These types of government funding are often backward-looking as they are based on year-end financial reporting. That's why they are often slow to materialise and can come in many months or even years after the company has invested in R&D. 
R&D Finance companies bridge the gap between when the company needs funding and when the local tax authority can make a payment. This payout can happen 6-12 months earlier than the usual timeline. This type of financing is available to early-stage companies, even to those that are pre-revenue. Companies like Fundsquire offer this service in Australia. Globally, other forms of R&D funding also count SRED financing in Canada and R&D tax credit finance in the UK.Revenue-based fundingRevenue-based financing (RBF) is a form of funding where investors give capital to a company in return for a percentage of continuing revenues. This payment usually happens until the principal or capital amount is repaid, plus a negotiated multiple. These types of funding mechanisms are typically long-term and range from one to five years in length. 
For companies that have little collateral but a steady stream of revenue, like e-commerce and fast-moving consumer goods, RBF makes a lot of sense, even in this climate. Lenders are still looking for good deals, and both RBF financiers and high-quality borrowers can benefit from a long term agreement in these uncertain times. If your company has no collateral but is revenue-generating and growing steadily, RBF might still be a great source of capital at this time. 
CrowdfundingCrowdfunding leverages your ability to sell your value proposition for cash. The two main types of crowdfunding, equity and rewards-based crowdfunding, have both been hit slightly by the crisis, but not significantly. In a study by Enventys Partners looking at the volume and success rate of Kickstarter campaigns, it was found that ""From January to April 3, 2020, campaigns generated a total of $20,245,501, which is up from $12,810,399 during the same period in 2019. Average first-day funding increased 45% from 2019 to 2020 with this year's campaigns bringing in an average of $7,826."" Overall, with the increased audience of web-based funding platforms, the expected crowdfunding crunch is much less worrying than for other funding sources. The key to successful crowdfunding is still having a great pitch, some engaging collateral, and a demonstrable product, but if those are your company's strengths, then this might be the way to go.  
Conclusion
The global pandemic could be remembered as the challenge of a generation. However, there are still many ways to keep going and even thrive amongst the chaos. Outlined here a few of these avenues in this post, but if you have some funding ideas that forgot to mention, we would love to hear about them. About FundsquireFundsquire is a global leader in R&D Finance, with offices in the UK, Canada, and Australia. We help companies around the world protect their equity and increase their investments in growth by enabling them to access their R&D tax credits cost-effectively and as early as they need them. Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/document-first-approach-can-eliminate-flood-of-virtual-meetings,How a document-first approach can eliminate the flood of virtual meetings,"BlogHow a document-first approach can eliminate the flood of virtual meetings6 May 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•A different approach -  typing before talking•The medium•Be wary of long documents•When you do eventually have a meetingWritten by Craig Rees, VP Cards, Payments & EngineeringAs most of us are indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every interaction we are having for business or pleasure is happening online – and it’s mostly happening on virtual conferencing tools like Zoom. While it presents many opportunities to connect with our family, friends and colleagues in a difficult time like this, it has also packed our daily routines with nonstop video calls. Frankly, it can be quite exhausting.At Airwallex, we embrace a culture of inclusive decision-making across our global teams. We are proud of this culture as we value the opinion of our employees no matter where they are based. This does come with some challenges in today’s climate, however. We use instant messaging tools like Slack for quick conversations and swift decision-making. For important decisions that require more thought, a meeting was typically organised, stakeholders were invited, and we’d spend a significant proportion of the meeting getting up to speed on the issue at hand. This worked great for us before COVID-19, but with our current remote practices, our usual method has led to schedules fully filled up with Zoom meetings. This is not an effective and productive approach to getting things done. In order to be successful in the remote working environment, we need to ensure that our working practices can utilise the skills and experience of our global teams while providing ample time to complete their day-to-day tasks.To overcome the challenge of ‘too many virtual meetings’, we need to carefully consider how we can continue with a goal of inclusion and at the same time be mindful of everyone's workload. One of the ways to mitigate this is to inculcate a document-first approach – a mechanism by which everyone can contribute in their own time.A different approach -  typing before talkingMost of us instinctively “call a meeting” as the initial action to kicking off a discussion. A document-first approach encourages us to instead start with a document covering all the relevant points and requesting input and feedback from all interested parties.In this document, questions can be asked and answered, the discussion can be had and tracked. After an appropriate period, we can review outstanding items and then call a meeting to align, noting that everyone involved will be fully across the background of the topic. This point of this is to limit a conversation in a meeting to the only points that need a deeper interaction.
By moving to a document-first approach, we will free individuals up to contribute in their own time and only bring stakeholders together when the domain is fully understood by all parties, leading to less wastage and greater effectiveness.The mediumOffline documents will not work in this approach. Choose an online collaborative tool with real-time multi-user input, co-authoring and commenting, such as Confluence or Google Docs. At Airwallex, we use a combination of both. A Google Doc set up in an individual drive can get orphaned and lost, hence we recommend creating these in shared Google drives or having them linked back to a Confluence page for easier discovery later down the track.Be wary of long documentsWith this proposed new approach, I am wary of ending up back in the 1980s where software development was driven by a hundred-page functional specification. This is definitely not what I am advocating for. Documents should have a clear scope, a defined outcome and not be too long.
I recommend sticking to two types of documents – the first being a one or two-page ‘abstract document’ that covers a high-level topic, for example, when and where an idea is starting out. The second type of document can delve into the details and can span 10 pages if necessary.When you do eventually have a meetingPre-meeting: When it is time to get people together, make full use of the time. Set an agenda and indicate the expected outcomes from the meeting so that the session can be as productive as possible.During: Do not just listen - take notes. Document points, questions, actions and decisions as you go, as this can help with comprehension especially when participants are remote.Post-meeting: Send out an update, confirm what was decided, document any follow on actions. This will ensure that those participants who didn’t come to the meeting can still be fully across and involved in the process.A number of teams at Airwallex have already started to implement this approach, and we’re already seeing the benefits. People appreciate it when we are respectful of their time, and this, in turn, fosters greater productivity in a virtual environment.Our products and services in Australia are provided by Airwallex Pty Ltd ABN 37 609 653 312 who holds AFSL 487221.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/using-cloud-software-to-manage-your-export-teams-remotely,Three ways to improve how your business manages importing and exporting remotely,"BlogThree ways to improve how your business manages importing and exporting remotely24 April 2020•4 MinutesBusiness tipsContributed by Airwallex Partner IncoDocsWith the onset of COVID-19, remote work has been thrust into the limelight this year with many companies asking their employees to work from home due to social distancing measures. New ways of working have left many teams working separately from one another, sometimes for the first time, causing considerable implications for global trade businesses who rely on physical tools and traditional processes.
Transitioning to remote work can be quite a daunting task, especially without the right tools. Thankfully there is now a wealth of new technologies available at our fingertips to solve this, even in the importing and exporting space. Below, we provide a few examples of how buyers and sellers can use cloud software like IncoDocs and Airwallex to effectively manage your import and export teams remotely. 
1. Create and share quotes, proforma invoices and commercial invoices IncoDocs’ cloud software allows importers and exporters all over the world to create and share all sales and shipping documentation required for global trade. This allows teams to work remotely and connect to a shared team workspace to create and share quotations, proforma invoices, commercial Invoices and other shipping documentation.
2. Streamline the sales process to help buyers and sellers confirm deals faster
Using IncoDocs, sellers can share proforma invoices and sales contracts to buyers to accept, digitally counter-sign and make payments of supplier’s invoices, 100% online while working remotely. Digital stamps and signature technology allows both buyers and sellers to transition to a paperless office. Sellers can add their company stamp and digital signatures, then share documents to buyers so they can countersign proforma invoices and sales contracts. This completely eliminates the manual print, sign, scan and email process and provides a 100% paperless process.3. Easy payments, no matter the currency
When a buyer has accepted a proforma invoice, payment can be made in 34 different currencies using Airwallex’s proprietary FX engine. Buyers will gain access to real, interbank FX rates with zero international transaction fees, making it a cost-effective way to settle payments in just a few clicks. Airwallex payments are sent using local payment methods so payments can be received in full by the seller in two business days or less.
Once deals have been confirmed and paid, users simply click to convert invoices into shipments without having to re-type any data to create a suite of compliant shipping documentation required for the International shipping process. Importers, exporters and trading companies can easily upgrade their old process; transition to a paperless office and provide teams with a unified platform to successfully survive and thrive in a remote working environment.
Traditionally, importers and exporters have had to rely on a very manual, paper-heavy process just to negotiate quotes, invoices, countersign contracts and make international payments. With the introduction of new technology and fantastic new business tools, export teams are able to adapt and bring remote work into their arsenal to maintain productivity without a fixed address. 
Combining IncoDocs & Airwallex’ cloud software gives importers and exporters the power to streamline their processes, reduce costs and successfully manage their businesses in a remote working environment.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-avoid-paying-foreign-transaction-fees,How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees,"BlogHow to avoid paying foreign transaction fees24 April 2020•4 minutesBusiness tipsFinanceIn this article•Common foreign transaction fees•How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees on transfers•How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees on card payments•How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees when buying supplies from overseas•Avoid paying foreign transaction fees altogetherFor any business, setting a budget is crucial to account for the money coming in but also the expenses to be paid out. Regular expenses can include anything from operational purchases, capital purchases, bills, and staff wages, but not all expenses can be predicted ahead of time.Certain transaction fees, such as bank fees, can include hidden costs that were not accounted for and can easily eat away at a perfectly crafted budget.  Foreign transaction fees can be notoriously high, and a hidden, poor FX rate leads to more money in your bank’s pocket, and less in yours.Here are some of the common foreign transaction fees to look out for.Common foreign transaction feesCurrency conversion feesWhen you purchase or pay money internationally you get charged a fee for the conversion of your currency into the receiving currency. This is typically around 1-4% of the total amount. You can expect this fee whether you pay by credit card, bank transfer, or other methods.Dynamic currency conversion feesHave you ever paid an international supplier and had the option to pay in AUD? While you think you may avoid foreign transactions, you’ll still be charged a fee—in this case, a fee for a third party undertaking the conversion. When using this method, keep an eye on the exchange rate on offer as it’s usually significantly less than the real, interbank FX rate.
Credits card and payment network feesForeign transaction fees on credit cards are one of the more common transaction fees. Typically charged at 1-3% by banks, credit card companies, and payment networks, you receive these fees to cover the cost of conversion from all parties involved. Namely, from your bank, the recipient’s bank, and from the payment network that was used in this transaction.Banks are also known to charge high flat fees for these payments, from $6 up to $30, per transaction. So if you make a lot of international payments, this adds up fast.How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees on transfersAs a business with international vendors, international payments are inevitable. But foreign transaction fees don’t have to be.If you choose to do a bank-to-bank international transfer, this means you’re leveraging local bank networks to pay your vendors, rather than using the SWIFT network. In this case, you’ll only need to pay minimal bank transfer fees, instead of the hefty SWIFT transfer fee.In some cases, you may be able to open a bank account or credit card in your vendor’s country, although this can be tricky for foreign businesses.A way to avoid paying foreign transaction fees on transfers is to use a transfer provider that looks out for businesses like yours. Airwallex helps you make international transfers easily. We don’t charge you any foreign transaction fees, and you only need to pay a small 0.3-0.6% margin on your FX. How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees on card paymentsCredit cards make international payments quick and easy. But if you don’t do your research, some cards can hit you with high foreign transaction fees.It always pays to read the fine print of your card provider to see their fee structure. If you find that their fees are too high, consider switching to a different card. Or choose a new credit card provider altogether.These days there are numerous credit cards available where you won’t pay any foreign transaction fees.If you’re after an even more flexible service, Airwallex Borderless Cards are a smart option to avoid paying foreign transaction fees on your card payments. There are no monthly fees, no annual fees, and you won’t pay any fees on foreign transactions. Just a small margin on FX of either 0.3% or 0.6%.
How to avoid paying foreign transaction fees when buying supplies from overseasEven in disrupted times like we’re living in today, businesses can’t avoid buying supplies from overseas. But there are ways to make the process more cost-effective.You can choose to pay the supplier in their local currency via a bank-to-bank transfer. This way you avoid the SWIFT network, and extra bank fees.It’s also smart to double-check your preferred payment method prior to paying, particularly for big-ticket items. These methods are normally charged as a fee percentage, which means your costs scale as your purchases do.
Avoid paying foreign transaction fees altogetherAirwallex is designed to ease the fee burden on businesses.With our products, you get access to our interbank FX rate, which is up to 90% cheaper than anything offered by the banks. And with only a minimal (and transparent) margin on top, you know exactly what you’re paying per transaction.Our Borderless Card payment options have zero foreign transaction fees, and no monthly fees, so there’s no charge simply for using the service.Airwallex Foreign Currency Accounts mean you can hold a business account in a foreign currency, where you can receive and pay money directly in your desired currency—avoiding the banks entirely.Airwallex enables you to make your payments faster, with less hassle, and at a better rate.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/series-d-round-what-it-mean-for-our-partners,Airwallex’s Series D round — what it means for our partners,"BlogAirwallex’s Series D round — what it means for our partners16 April 2020•4 minutesCompany newsIn this article•Firstly, thank you to our existing partners•More opportunities for growth with AirwallexWritten by Gajia Parsons, VP - Partnerships & EcosystemAn exciting day for the Airwallex team - we’ve just announced our US$160M series D fundraising round, our largest to date and with participation from exciting new investors ANZi Ventures and Salesforce Ventures. It’s reassuring to receive this validation of our progress and the strong strategic vision that resonates so clearly throughout our business. So, what does this all mean for our partners?Firstly, thank you to our existing partnersWe’ve been fortunate to have worked with partners - the best in their categories - who we trust and who share our sense of urgency to innovate. They are organisations filled with forward-thinking individuals and teams. They don’t shudder at our ambitious timelines. They accurately understand how our platform is relevant for both SMEs and enterprises. They share our aspirations for international expansion. And, perhaps most importantly, they appreciate that constant, but considered, iteration to our game plan is essential for success. Over the past 12 months, we’ve partnered with the Visa team in APAC to launch our Airwallex Borderless Card, bringing together Airwallex’s market-leading international foreign exchange rates with the benefits of paying with Visa. We worked alongside the Shopify team in Asia to educate customers about the ease at which they can be truly global businesses and reach global markets without being burdened by the complexities that were once associated with accessing customers in multiple countries. We went live with our integration to Xero - a feature requested by so many of our customers - to help businesses who have multi currency needs, better manage their cash flow.These are just some examples. The register of ‘thank yous’ is long and also extends to our growing list of global, regional and local bank partners who we work closely with around the world to stretch boundaries and launch first-in-market solutions. We are grateful for those who have worked together with us so far to build this fully integrated end-to-end financial services platform for businesses of all sizes. More opportunities for growth with AirwallexWe will continue to work hard to bring the Airwallex offering to more and more businesses around the world. The newly raised funds will accelerate our expansion in markets such as the Middle East, Europe and the US and also be invested in growing our suite of products. Selecting the right partners with complementary capabilities to address the needs of customers in these new markets and channels will be a process we pay meticulous attention to. I’ve no doubt that those who partner with us will be rewarded with growth opportunities, new learnings and satisfied customers.With the current state of the world, it is more evident than ever before in our lifetimes that businesses like Airwallex, who have the DNA to be able to adapt and create quickly, have the responsibility to step up to help solve problems that are crippling businesses across the globe. We’ll work with partners to share intellectual property and infrastructure to bring solutions to life as quickly as possible. We will invest resources into tackling new use cases, experiment together and reduce risk together. The intangibles of a successful partnership, such as executive sponsorship and support, will be critical.
Through this global pandemic, we are going to see dramatic shifts in how businesses (big and small) evaluate, select and use technology. We’re excited to work together with our partners, both new and existing, to continue to support our customers’ needs and provide them with a truly borderless financial services experience.Related article: Airwallex Closes US$160M in Record Fundraising RoundBack to blogShareSubscribe for our latest updates straight to your inboxLoading...",blogs
https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-to-adapt-your-business-during-this-time-of-crisis,How to adapt your business during this time of crisis,"BlogHow to adapt your business during this time of crisis8 April 2020•5 minutesBusiness tipsWritten by Jack Zhang, CEO and Co-founder of AirwallexBy now, all of us have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis in one way or another. It has brought a global economic shutdown, and with it, a great number of businesses, especially small businesses, are struggling. Many are still coming to terms with the severity of this crisis and its long-term implications while figuring out how to survive these unprecedented challenges. However, I hold the firm belief that any setback also presents an opportunity. Looking back at the SARS outbreak in early 2000, this event accelerated the adoption of e-commerce in China. Companies like Alibaba and JD.com adapted to this crisis and emerged stronger than ever post-SARS. Today, these two companies are the biggest e-commerce companies in China. Even in China today, post COVID-19, we have witnessed a sharp impact on traditional industries that have been affected by self-quarantine measures such as mining, manufacturing and traditional retail. In contrast, we have continued to see e-commerce thrive and I truly believe this shift to digital and online will continue even after the lockdown ends, life normalises and shops reopen.  It is therefore crucial for businesses to adapt now and capture some of these consumer behaviour shifts to not only ride out the impact of COVID-19, but be even better positioned after it ends. Here are my thoughts on how businesses can adapt to changing economic conditions. 
1. Deliver your product through digital channels to meet the new demandBusinesses that traditionally have been reliant on physical locations and on-site staff can continue to keep their doors open by leveraging digital channels to deliver their products or services. It is now easier than ever to take your business online through e-commerce platforms like Shopify or virtual meeting tools like Zoom. Some companies have already proactively looked ahead and made significant changes to meet these shifts. For example, Pokéd, an Australian restaurant with nine stores across Melbourne and Sydney selling healthy Hawaiian-inspired poké bowls, lost its business crowd in usually high-traffic CBD areas when companies started to work from home. To adapt to this new environment, they have since focused on building an online store to deliver ready-to-cook poké meals in packs of ten and at a discounted cost for the bulk purchase. They are already seeing the benefits of this shift through higher value transactions and lower fixed costs.  Gyms and fitness centres are also adjusting to increased digital consumption. A number of gyms are now creating online workout content or holding online coaching classes on Facebook Live or Zoom to keep their members engaged. 2. Increase your customer base quickly by tapping into online communities and marketplacesOver the last few years, the number of online marketplaces has exploded due to the convenience and variety they offer to consumers. Participating in these marketplaces can also be a great way to super-charge your customer base during these times, as they can generate mass awareness and access to a large global customer base quickly. Examples of these are food and beverage platforms. F&B outlets and restaurants are increasingly getting online into marketplaces such as UberEats and Deliveroo. Although they may make a lower profit margin per order, the benefit is that they can access larger volumes of orders very quickly. In a similar manner, physical retailers who no longer see in-store traffic can stay in business by setting up an online Amazon or eBay storefront, immediately making their goods available to customers all around the world.
Facebook communities are also a powerful way of communicating with targeted groups of customers. For example, a business selling musical instruments can look up musician communities on Facebook to sell directly to their target audience.3. Adapt your pricing model to access cash flow and ensure customer loyalty
Every business in this environment is struggling for cash. Creative ways to unlock cash flow will be critical for businesses during this period. One way to do this is by offering a discounted price for a long-term subscription to a service or product. A great example of this is the Malaysian arm of low-cost carrier AirAsia. They have launched an Unlimited Pass that allows unlimited travel across certain countries for a year, at a price of RM$499 (approximately $190 AUD). A low-cost deal for unlimited travel will attract customers to purchase with AirAsia in a time when no one is travelling or buying flight tickets, helping them with their cash flow. It also means that customers will choose AirAsia when borders open up again, driving customer retention.Whether your company is offline with limited ability to offer a service right now or a technology subscription service, think of ways to be creative with your pricing to unlock short-term cash flow while ensuring customer loyalty during COVID-19 recovery.  --Each business may be facing a different situation, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer to responding to the epidemic. However, my encouragement is for businesses to continue to adapt and accelerate in whatever ways they can in the current environment.For any offline businesses, look for ways to shift your business online wherever possible. For those businesses that are already online, look for ways to scale even further by tapping into online communities and marketplaces. While your business may be sailing through unchartered territory right now, I hope that implementing even a small amount of these recommendations will land you in a much better position post COVID-19.Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/building-business-culture,6 pieces of advice for building a healthy business culture,"Blog6 pieces of advice for building a healthy business culture2 April 2020•7 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•What is business culture?•Why business culture is important•How to build a healthy business cultureWhen you think of a successful business, what do you picture?More than just profits and global reach, a successful business can be defined by its culture—good or bad. But building a healthy business culture doesn’t just happen. It has to be nurtured.The good news is that it’s never too late to start.What is business culture?“Culture” by itself is a difficult thing to define. Culture provides an unspoken framework for guiding group behaviour. It’s a mentality, it’s demonstrated in actions.Business culture is the mentality that’s employed at your company. It’s how we act within the business, and how we expect others to act.Why business culture is importantYour business culture can promote either a positive or negative view of your company. It tells people outside your business everything they need to know about it—without you even saying a word.A bad business culture—a culture of mistrust, old-fashioned thinking, working to the limit of stress—breeds a toxic working environment. It doesn’t promote collaboration, and actively encourages people to leave. On the other hand, a good company culture is inclusive and supportive. It creates happier staff and boosts employee engagement because they feel respected and supported by their chain of command. It encourages productivity because staff understand how their actions feed into the business’ goals. It promotes loyalty, by actively strengthening staff retention. And if people work in an environment where they’re supported, positively challenged, and can see where their efforts are directed, why would they want to leave?How to build a healthy business culture1. Clearly define the values and mission of your companyYour values and mission provide the structure and goal of your business. Why does the company exist? What do you believe in? Where are we planning to take this business?Defining your values and mission provides a roadmap that everyone in the business can understand, and works to fuel a passion for the task, the role, the project at hand. Clearly defining your values and mission means that everyone in the business understands what the business does, why you do it, and how their role fits into this. Working within the company values and understanding the business mission provides a sense of purpose and ownership over one’s work. 2. Actively look to hire people that fit the values and missionIn theory, hiring the best people should work to grow your business. But if their personality doesn’t fit your business culture, then these relationships won’t work out. High-performing staff who don’t care about your business’ goal don’t last.It’s much better to hire a worker who’s passionate about and engaged with your organisation, who actively want to be a part of your business and then upskill them. Because skills can be taught—passion can’t.3. Listen to all employeesCommunication within a business should be two-way. It shouldn’t just be management dictating to its workers. It involves listening.When management actively listens to their teams and encourage a culture of open, honest communication, a greater level of trust will grow within your business. Employees then feel supported by their managers.This boosts staff confidence that they can speak honestly. They feel empowered to provide feedback, brainstorm new ideas, and not be afraid to give things a try. Because after all, good ideas can come from anywhere.
4. Hire staff that are ‘better than you’, then listen to themIt’s a simple concept, and one championed vocally by Steve Jobs. After all, your staff are your greatest asset.“It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.” - Steve JobsSo, therefore, it makes sense to hire talent that you identify as being smarter than you. The talent who you know thinks differently to you, who bring extra skills to the table. This builds diverse thinking and enables the business to look towards its goals with a different lens.So look for the staff who challenge you, who push you to be better.5. Empower team members to make their own decisionsBuilding trust and support within your teams empowers your staff to feel as though they can make their own decisions. They take accountability for their work, and they know that any success that comes from their work is celebrated. Encouraging independent decision-making leads to a more resilient workforce. Staff feel confident to continue their roles during any periods of uncertainty or volatility.So give them the tools to take control of their decisions. Cloud collaboration software, shared project management tools, and responsibility for their own budget. Airwallex Multi-Currency Cards are the perfect way to enable them to make their own purchase decisions!Building a healthy business culture means empowering your teams to succeed.6. Encourage flexibilityEncouraging flexibility demonstrates that you care about your staff. You understand that they have lives and passions outside of their occupation. They don’t live to work—they work to live.Flexibility can mean flexible working hours, adjustable start times to suit different family situations, the option to work from home, and even remote work. Flexibility keeps the role interesting while building in support to live a life outside of their job.A successful business starts with a healthy company cultureIt’s never too late to start nurturing a healthy business culture, one small change can start the process rolling. Anyone of the tactics mentioned above will work to build trust, support, passion, and confidence can take your business anywhere.With the right business culture, your organisation can achieve anything.Ready to scale your business with Airwallex business account?

 Improving your cashflow isn’t just relegated to your financial team. Here are a few smart solutions you can employ to boost your cashflow, without resorting to cost-cutting, stock-cutting, or downsizing.What is cashflow management?Your business cashflow is the total amount of money that comes into your business through sales, and leaves your business through your expenses. Cashflow management is the act of tracking this money—and it’s a crucial step for regular, sustained business growth.
The importance of good cashflow managementWithout good cashflow management, you’re effectively blindfolding your business.Keeping a close eye on your business’ cashflow each month ensures that you always know how much money you currently have, how much is scheduled to come in, and how much you need to keep to pay your suppliers and staff. Having a clear record and forecast for your monthly business cashflow means you can ensure you retain a positive cashflow. This record allows you to gain insight into where your money is spent, where you receive it from, and then analyse this data and use this to create an accurate budget for the future. Importantly, it also allows you to know how much you can re-investment into your business to drive further growth. 6 ways to improve your cashflow managementYes, cutting down on costs and increasing your prices does boost your cashflow, but it doesn’t necessarily improve how your cashflow is managed. Here are six smart, effective tactics you can employ to improve your business’ cashflow management.1. Create a cashflow forecastAll the data you’ve gathered on your business’ finances allows you to generate a cashflow forecast. This is a critical tool for businesses—it’s the roadmap that tells you where you’re going. With a thorough cashflow forecast, your business is able to plan effectively for the future. Using this historical data you can estimate your projected incomings and outgoings, and be better prepared for the highs and lows that come with running a business. It’s also a useful tool to measure your business’ performance and see whether you’re out-performing or underperforming, compared to your previous years.2. Delay your payments and pay suppliers on the invoice’s due dateOne benefit of good business cashflow management is that, when done right, it enables you to maximise the interest you generate on the funds you have in your business bank account.By sending payments to your suppliers on their specific due date, rather than any time before, this enables your business to keep funds in your account for longer. These funds sit in your account, generating daily interest until it’s time to pay your suppliers. These small amounts of interest add up and are an effortless way to increase your income.3. Make your money work for youPutting your funds into a high-interest savings account enables you to earn a competitive interest rate on the money currently sitting in your account. This further compounds the value of paying your invoices on their due date and is a low-effort way to improve your business’ cashflow. After all, every little bit helps.4. Match payment termsA smart way to improve cashflow is to ensure that both your customer and supplier payment terms are the same. For example, if you’re offering your customers 45-60 days’ payment, but your suppliers expect your payment within 30 days, this creates a large gap in your cashflow. Matching these two up means that there’s no payment vacuum, and your income and outgoings always operate to a regular cycle.5. Take advantage of ‘continuity’ salesConsider offering a deal to your customers on products or services that they purchase for a set time period. For example, you might run a subscription-based business such as a magazine, or a cybersecurity service. Your customers usually pay monthly for their subscription. One way to improve your cash flow is to offer an up-front deal for a longer period subscription, say for one year, or even two years. Your customers save money upfront on the price of their subscription, and your business receives the cash upfront.6. Save on international transaction feesAs the world becomes more borderless, more businesses will be making international transactions, however, banks still charge significant fees on these transactions. The banks typically charge 4-5% above what a peer-to-peer payment service provider may charge on international FX rates. For card payments, they typically charge 3% on every international transaction. If a business is spending $500,000 on international transactions, they could improve their cashflow by up to $20,000 a year just by finding a cheaper alternative. Improve your cashflow with AirwallexAirwallex is an Australian fintech that allows businesses to put all of these tactics into effect. Airwallex enables you to:transfer funds to your international suppliers directly in their local currency, so they’re received faster.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/managing-foreign-exchange-risk-in-times-of-high-volatility,Managing foreign exchange risk in times of high volatility,"BlogManaging foreign exchange risk in times of high volatility31 March 2020•7 minutesFinanceBusiness tipsIn this article•What is foreign exchange risk?•Sources of foreign exchange risk•The danger for businesses•Managing foreign exchange riskWritten by: Rylan Dawes, VP of FX Product, AirwallexAny currency can experience periods of high volatility. The current COVID-19 situation is introducing levels of volatility in foreign currency markets not seen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.These levels of volatility can make or break a business that relies on importing or exporting goods, however, you can minimise these risks by having the right measures in place.What is foreign exchange risk?In simple terms, foreign exchange risk is the risk imposed on a business’ financial performance by changes in currency exchange rates. These fluctuating exchange rates can damage a business’ profitability by eating into margins.Sources of foreign exchange riskEssentially, any situation in which a business uses foreign currency can be considered a foreign exchange risk. But businesses that deal with more than one currency are more prone to foreign exchange risk than others.These risks can come from:Receiving income (including interest, dividends, royalties, etc) and revenue in foreign currencyNeeding to make payments in foreign currency to suppliersBusiness loans made in foreign currencyHolding offshore assets, such as international business subsidiariesThe danger for businessesThere are a number of ways that volatile foreign exchange can impact your business. For example:If you’re an importer, a falling domestic exchange rate can increase import costs, damaging your profitability. For example, if you are an Australian business importing from the US, a falling AUD can be harmful to your business. If you’re an exporter, a falling exchange rate typically benefits you as your product pricing will become more competitive. However a rising exchange rate will be harmful to your product pricing.If you’re a local producer, rising domestic exchange rates can give importers more of a competitive edge over your products, and you lose your business to overseas producers.But while typically volatile exchange rates can make a business nervous, there are a number of proven strategies that enable effective hedging against foreign exchange risk.Managing foreign exchange riskSpot transactionsSpot transactions, or spot contracts, are probably the easiest way to manage foreign investment risk. A spot transaction is a single foreign exchange transaction, where you purchase and settle the amount ‘on the spot’ (or rather, within two business days). It provides very little notice time, and a shorter window for risk, so if you’re happy with the current foreign exchange rate, you can book in a conversion with a spot transaction. While this might mean you forego a better rate in the future, it does minimise the risk of future volatility in your desired foreign currency right now.A Forward Exchange Contract (FEC)A FEC allows your business to guard itself against price fluctuations by locking down an exchange rate at the current price, which is valid until a date set by you. While this contract provides peace of mind that you won’t actively lose money on your foreign exchange, it does mean that you can’t take advantage of any positive shift in foreign exchange rates.Another downside is the fees imposed on this contract. A FEC locks in a specified sum of money. So for example, if you lock in US$10,000, but at the end of the contract you only needed US$8,500, then there is a contractual cost to cancel this remaining portion.Natural hedgeFor businesses that are already selling overseas (for example in the US), foreign currency bank accounts can also provide a great way to provide a natural hedge. For these businesses, rather than receiving in USD and converting to AUD, you can leave your USD balance in your USD foreign currency account. This is especially convenient if you have expenses also in USD as you can hedge against any fluctuations in AUD by just holding USD in your account. You also save on any potential double conversion fees the banks may charge (for example, converting from AUD to USD and then back to AUD). Foreign currency bank accountsA simple way to manage foreign currency risk involves setting up a foreign currency account. Then, to hedge against risk, simply deposit the required amount (plus a nominated surplus) into the account. This method allows you to make the most of FX rates when they’re strong, by converting and holding the foreign currency until you need to make payment. It also ensures the correct funds will always be available and takes into account the potential fluctuations of the currency.If you need help managing your businesses’ foreign exchange risk, why not sign up today and book a time with one of our product specialists who are more than happy to assist.Related article: How to Get the Best Foreign Exchange RateOur products and services in Australia are provided by Airwallex Pty Ltd ABN 37 609 653 312 who holds AFSL 487221.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/what-is-the-swift-payment-network,What is the SWIFT Payment Network?,"BlogWhat is the SWIFT Payment Network?31 March 2020•6 minutesFinanceIn this article•What is SWIFT?•History of SWIFT•How the SWIFT network operates•Using the wrong SWIFT code•Making a SWIFT payment•The costs involved with a SWIFT payment•SWIFT payment timeframes•Discover the alternative to SWIFTIn this modern-day and age, it often feels like money is sent internationally in the blink of an eye. However, the majority of these international transfers are carried out among banks via the SWIFT network.
It’s not something you necessarily think about, but the SWIFT network provides the infrastructure that underpins your international money transfers. Some people still refer to these as ‘wire transfers’.
In this article, we’ll delve into what a SWIFT payment actually is and how SWIFT payment works.
What is SWIFT?SWIFT is an acronym that stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. So SWIFT itself isn’t just a payment method; it’s an organisation. 
The SWIFT network has been around since 1973 and was created to establish a series of common processes to standardise international payments. Since its inception, it has grown to include over 10,000 financial institutions spanning 212 countries all across the world, providing a secure, fast, consistent method for banks to transfer currency between countries.
History of SWIFTFounded in the 1970s, SWIFT presented a novel idea to establish an international financial service. Fifteen countries united with more than 200 banks to reconcile the issue of moving funds across borders and determine how best to navigate financially among countries.
In 1973, the introduction of SWIFTNet provided ultimate security and a private network to protect financial transfers worldwide. Banks relied on the TELEX system until 1977 when the SWIFT banking system introduced its more modern messaging service. TELEX used a wire system, similar to traditional telegraphs that can transmit text-based messages between banks, notifying of a money transfer — hence the current term ‘wire transfer’.
In 1980, SWIFT processed more than 45 million messages. Simplified standards created a common language to make worldwide financial affairs more attainable. During the next decade, SWIFT grew globally into a secure, efficient and reliable messaging service supporting international finances. 
SWIFT was recognised in 1991 with the Computerworld Smithsonian Information Technology Award for establishing a common standard across the financial telecommunications industry. Five years later, SWIFT was processing more than 3 million messages daily. 
By 2009, SWIFT had reached a global status, transmitting 3.76 billion messages annually. By advancing with the times, SWIFT continues to create innovative technology and methodology to remain the leading network in global financial services. 
SWIFT expanded to India in 2014, and SWIFT India was incorporated into the financial messaging service. SWIFT’s key to success is providing quality services with an overall cost reduction for users. 
How the SWIFT network operatesUnlike current peer-to-peer currency transfer platforms, SWIFT isn’t a portal that transfers money from one bank to the other. It transfers information.
Interestingly, the SWIFT network doesn’t actually transfer your money. Instead, it creates a payment order that gets passed between the different financial institutions’ accounts. 
This is known as a SWIFT code and consists of a unique series of 8-11 characters that are used to identify the specific bank where your money is headed. SWIFT codes are also known as Bank Identifier Codes (BIC).
When we break this down, we see that each SWIFT code is made up of a string of different codes:
A 4-letter financial institution code
A 2-letter country code
A 2-digit code for the city or location
If applicable, a 3-digit individual branch code (although SWIFT codes don’t always include this)
It’s these codes that get transferred between banks, and the end result is money arriving at its destination.
The SWIFT network acts as an information transport network, connecting your money’s original location to its final destination via a series of banks. Your money is then transferred from country to country, passing between different financial institutions until it reaches its endpoint.
For almost 50 years, SWIFT has maintained its excellent standing as the primary worldwide financial hub. SWIFT has continuously evolved as the international leader in financial communications by remaining innovative, secure and reliable. The network’s future is bright as it expands every day into new offices globally. 
Using the wrong SWIFT codeUsing the wrong SWIFT code, or simply getting it wrong, can result in your transfer being delayed, or not being sent at all.
Making a SWIFT paymentBanks usually publish their SWIFT code on their website, however, you can also perform a search of the SWIFT database to find the specific financial institution you’re looking for. It’s always best to check with your bank prior to sending, though, to make sure you’re using the best code.Making a SWIFT payment involves the following steps.You go to your bank and provide them with the receiving bank account, and the bank’s SWIFT code.Your bank then sends a SWIFT message to the receiving bank, communicating your request to transfer money.The bank receives the SWIFT communication and allows the money to be credited to the receiving bank account.The costs involved with a SWIFT paymentWhen making a SWIFT payment, it’s important to confirm that your bank is actually part of the SWIFT network. If so, you’re set up to make payments. However, there are a number of fees to be aware of when making a SWIFT payment.As you’re transferring between banks, each intermediary bank will likely charge a handling fee or commission for their service. Your bank may charge a flat rate to cover these fees, so it pays to check first. Given the international nature of the SWIFT payment network, there is no set table of fees.If your transfer involves exchanging currency from one to another, be aware of your exchange rate. Banks have been known to offer poor exchange rates on SWIFT payments, and they end up keeping the difference. The rate banks charge can be up to 4-5% higher than the interbank FX rate (what you find on Google).With these fees involved, transferring smaller amounts can end up being quite costly, and end up taking a large chunk out of your funds.SWIFT payment timeframesWhile the SWIFT network was created to be a faster, safer alternative for international transfers, the irony is that in terms of modern-day payments it can actually be quite slow. SWIFT transfers will usually take 24-48 hours to be completed, however depending on the complexity of the transfer, they can take up to five business days in some circumstances.

Fintech’s like Airwallex are revolutionising cross border payments with their priority technology. With Airwallex’s technology, businesses can bypass the SWIFT network, reducing fees while at the same time making payments faster (up to same day). Contact us today to book a demo, and discuss how Airwallex can streamline your international transfers.Related article: What is a telegraphic transferOur products and services in Australia are provided by Airwallex Pty Ltd ABN 37 609 653 312 who holds AFSL 487221.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-paying-overseas-suppliers,The ultimate guide to paying overseas suppliers,"BlogThe ultimate guide to paying overseas suppliers30 March 2020•6 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•Bank transfer•PayPal or credit card•Peer-to-peer currency transfers•Airwallex•The best way to pay overseas suppliers is with AirwallexIn today’s hyperconnected world, it’s easy to find, secure, and do business with international merchants and suppliers. Business is practically instant, and Google Translate can facilitate your communication; the only things slowing you down are different timezones, and how you go about paying your international suppliers.
One thing that will never change is that businesses of all sizes want a quick, reliable, cost-effective and secure method to make overseas payments. One delayed payment, or a couple of unexpected fees, and your relationship with a supplier can get derailed.Choosing the right international payment method can make all the difference in streamlining your international business relationships, so it’s crucial that you understand what’s involved with each one.Bank transferOne simple way to pay overseas suppliers is via bank transfer. All you need to know is their bank details, the transaction itself is run through the SWIFT network.
However, international bank transfers require a great deal of your time—and an even greater deal of trust. There is very little protection for merchants or suppliers, and no recourse from your bank in the chance your transaction goes wrong. On top of limited security, international bank transfers are typically slow, taking up to five business days or longer to be completed. You also face high fees on your transaction, ranging from $6 up to $30 or more. That’s per transaction. In some cases, you’re even charged fees to amend, cancel, or investigate any issues with your transfer. This is on top of the FX rate banks give, which can be 4-5% less the interbank FX rate (the rate you typically find on Google). So if you’re after a cheap, secure way to send money internationally, a bank transfer through one of the big banks may not be the best way to pay overseas suppliers.
PayPal or credit cardUsing your credit card or PayPal to pay overseas suppliers is a reasonably simple, straightforward method that works adequately for smaller payments. The benefits of PayPal include a good dispute resolution process, secure technology, and protection against fraud. However, PayPal charges both a percentage fee and a flat dollar fee per payment, which scales up based on the amount of money you’re sending.Also, when paying via PayPal you run the risk of account holds, declined payments (based on their perceived level of risk), laborious payment times, and the risk that your transaction may even be cancelled.While your credit card can be a suitable method for instant payment, you will be charged a high foreign transaction fee (typically 3%) on each payment.Peer-to-peer currency transfersPeer-to-peer transfers are picking up speed as personal payment platforms, but how do they measure up when paying overseas suppliers?The benefit of these types of platforms is that they provide quick payments, and charge less fees than the banks. But while they may be quicker than other methods, peer-to-peer transfers generally aren’t the safest way to pay overseas suppliers. These platforms don’t have security in place to protect their users, and their exchange rates typically aren’t as competitive as other methods.They are also quite slow in their processes, and it can take days for payments to clear.AirwallexIf you are making international payments and want a cost-effective, fast and secure way to send money, why not consider Airwallex? We believe Airwallex is the best way to pay overseas suppliers. It’s not just because we’re biased—it’s true. Some of the advantages of using Airwallex are:Our lightning-fast payment system means you can pay international suppliers practically instantaneously.

https://www.airwallex.com/blog/how-airwallex-china-worked-through-covid-19,Lessons Learnt: How Airwallex China worked through COVID-19,"BlogLessons Learnt: How Airwallex China worked through COVID-1926 March 2020•6 minutesBusiness tipsIn this article•1. Simulate a virtual office environment through digital collaboration tools•2. Continue to foster a results-driven culture among our remote teams•3. Tailor your communication approach to customers and partnersWritten by Lucy Liu, Co-founder and President, AirwallexThese are strange times we live in.The global COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new reality for all of us, with businesses reeling most from the impact and introducing significant changes. Many workforces across the world have turned to remote working, as travel restrictions and work-from-home directives are now widespread and mandated.Airwallex’s China office was the first to be affected by COVID-19. Having witnessed the impact first hand, my co-founders and I strongly believe that social distancing is the best way to curb the spread of the virus. In China, implementing work-from-home policies was a crucial step in adhering to social distancing recommendations.
At the same time, we still need to ensure that as a business, we are operating effectively despite the shift to remote working. Through some experimentation, we found that three key ways of remote working worked really well for us, which we have rolled out more broadly globally in the last few days to our other offices including Australia, UK and US. 1. Simulate a virtual office environment through digital collaboration toolsOne of the biggest downsides of remote working is the isolation - the loss of the usual office chatter and camaraderie with colleagues can have a profound impact on morale. However, self-isolation does not have to be a lonely experience. The breadth of online collaboration tools has given us ways to help replicate the experience of being with each other in the office. During our self-quarantine, we relied heavily on Slack and Zoom for instant messaging and video conference capabilities. To simulate a typical office environment, we created all-day Zoom Rooms within team squads - for example, with our China marketing team - that allowed us to be connected to our closest teammates. It almost felt like we were in the same office by being able to ‘pop in’ to the session anytime to say hi or ask a question. We also encouraged our teams to have their cameras on during Zoom meetings. We learnt from experience that speaking to each other via video (instead of just audio which felt like a typical phone call) increased rapport among participants and created a more collaborative virtual office environment. It was also nice to be able to get a glimpse of our colleagues’ personal lives - some joined calls with their babies or pets - which added some colour (and a few ‘awws’ as well) to the meeting.
Lastly, we have not forgotten to have some social fun. It is possible to still have a couple of the usual office social activities on Zoom, like Friday drinks. Our Australian team has really embraced that by organising ‘Water and Wine Cooler’ sessions for the whole team to come together at the end of every week to share stories of their work-from-home experiences. Drinks are BYO and creative custom Zoom backgrounds are encouraged! 2. Continue to foster a results-driven culture among our remote teamsOne of the things we are most proud of at Airwallex is our results-driven culture. We like to have fun, but also want to achieve results. With long-term remote working, we were initially concerned about productivity. Will we still get as much done?To mitigate this risk, our leadership team continued to set daily and weekly goals for their teams. Each team member also formed their individual daily plans and tracked progress against the most urgent priorities, increasing accountability and a deeper focus on results. We also instituted daily stand-ups amongst our teams, with senior leaders participating regularly to ensure that we were all aligned on priorities and tracking against progress. Each team member was accountable for his or her performance, and at the end of every week, sent a weekly update on progress to the business leaders.While it may sound like excessive reporting, over-communication is necessary during times like these. Our China teams found that these processes helped to drive focus - and we are hearing the same from our teams in Australia, UK and US. 
Even though we are not in the same physical office, it is important that we are still able to look back on each week and celebrate the progress we have made as a team. 3. Tailor your communication approach to customers and partnersAnother major shift in the new reality is the transition from offline to online. As we went fully digital and worked remotely, our customers did too.The widespread cancellation of events and meetings across the region eliminated opportunities for face-to-face interactions, meaning we had to seriously scale back on offline business development. Instead, we reinvested our resources into digital marketing and Wechat campaigns, as social media and mobile usage increased during this time of isolation.  We also used these channels more extensively to communicate with existing clients. In China in particular, this called for increased and deepened engagement with our customers on Wechat. Having Wechat groups for customers  became a common way to broadcast content and updates to our products. For example, we were able to inform customers instantly via Wechat when the Philippine government switched off their FX capabilities for 24 hours due to the COVID-19 situation.The new remote working culture has also increased social usage, as people turn to social media to be kept connected with the rest of the world and kept updated on news. This shift is evident in Australia, with Facebook and LinkedIn driving the majority of our leads in recent times. We surely will be paying more attention to these channels over the coming months.--- The pandemic will eventually come to an end, and when it does, we may see a seismic shift in the way we work, particularly remotely. At Airwallex, we are lucky to have already learnt many lessons through our China experience and we hope these lessons can help others as many more organisations shift to this operating model.

Scholarship recipients will be given priority consideration for internships at Airwallex.The Opportunity Fund: For students experiencing financial hardship, this fund will provide one-off payments for up to 100 students to support their studies, and is available throughout 2022 and 2023 to both domestic and international students. Student Enrichment Plan: A series of special activations, awards and facilities to foster innovation amongst students and alumni. This will include hackathons, guest lectures and talks from Airwallex leaders at key University events such as the Endeavour Exhibition, which Airwallex has been involved with since 2019.Future Idea Fund: A plethora of initiatives to increase access and exposure to training and careers in technology.Airwallex and University of Melbourne staff and students will also have the opportunity to co-locate in the Melbourne Connect innovation precinct. Located in Parkville, Melbourne Connect brings together world-class researchers, industry leaders, start-ups, government representatives and students seeking to leverage research and emerging technologies to disrupt and transform society. As a nod to the founders who were running a cafe in Melbourne’s CBD when they started exploring ideas that would become Airwallex, the company will provide free coffee at Melbourne Connect for students through the partnership.The partnership between Airwallex and the University of Melbourne will expand opportunities available for students, and in turn, grow the pool of future tech talent in Australia. This initiative comes at a time when the tech talent shortage continues to impact Australian businesses. The Tech Council of Australia has forecasted that Australia will need 653,000 additional people in tech jobs by 2030 to fuel the nation’s economic growth. Airwallex Co-founder, CEO, and University of Melbourne alum Jack Zhang, said, “Since our inception, Airwallex has strived to create opportunities for exponential career growth and development. Our partnership with the University of Melbourne marks a significant step-change in our contribution to building the tech leaders of tomorrow. It’s an honour and a privilege to be in a position to give back to the community that's been a part of the Airwallex story from day one.”“Airwallex was founded by looking beyond what’s possible, and we want to empower students to do the same. Whether through scholarships or grants, Airwallex guest lectures or events, our partnership aims to drive innovation and provide meaningful support to the next generation of technology professionals and leaders.”“We understand deeply the tech talent challenges facing businesses today. By providing students with opportunities and support from inside the sector, this partnership aims to grow the local talent pool and ultimately, strengthen Australia’s tech and startup ecosystem. I look forward to seeing the next generation of Australian tech leaders, entrepreneurs and innovators benefit from this partnership and make their mark in the world.”Dean of the University’s Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology Professor Mark Cassidy said the University was delighted with the new partnership.“It is very exciting to see alumni, such as Jack and his co-founders, achieve such success with their own business and be able to give back so generously to the next generation of technology professionals and Australia’s broader tech sector,” Professor Cassidy said.“The Airwallex scholarship and opportunity programs will make a real difference to our students’ ability to focus and continue with their studies each year, while the enrichment and idea programs will equip our students with the knowledge and mindset to become leaders in the workforce.”“This partnership exemplifies the University of Melbourne’s commitment to collaboration as a means of nurturing innovation. Bringing together world-class researchers and educators, industry and students, we cancreate an environment where great minds connect and incredible futures emerge.”“The Tech Council of Australia welcomes this exciting new partnership that will ensure more students gain crucial skills that will allow them better access to great Australian tech jobs. This partnership is a great example of the power of collaboration and how organisations can work together to improve and create new pathways to attract more students to consider and take up a career in tech,” said Tech Council of Australia CEO, Kate Pounder.ENDAbout AirwallexAirwallex is the leading financial technology platform for modern businesses growing beyond borders.

https://www.airwallex.com/newsroom/airwallex-finds-aussie-businesses-charging-ahead-with-global-expansion,Airwallex finds Aussie businesses charging ahead with global expansion,"AUSTRALIA, 1 SEPTEMBER 2022 – Australian businesses have ambitious plans for international expansion, as new data from global fintech Airwallex reveals more than two thirds of small-to-medium Aussie businesses (69 per cent) plan to be operating outside Australia by 2027. Airwallex’s inaugural Australian Business Growth Index found a third of SMEs surveyed (34 per cent) currently have operations overseas, but this is projected to more than double in the next five years.The independent research, which surveyed more than 200 Australian small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), found that businesses already operating in international markets are experiencing commercial success. Of these businesses, two in five surveyed (42 per cent) reported being profitable and more than half are breaking even (52 per cent).“Aussie businesses are bolstering their position to weather the current economic challenges,” said Sam Kothari, Head of Growth for ANZ at Airwallex. “International expansion is now being used as a strategy to remain resilient and viable by tapping into new markets and widening the pool of potential customers.”Moving overseas has unlocked new customer segments for SMEs and broadened their overall market share, with 80 per cent saying the volume of new customers they’ve gained from moving into new markets has been “significant”. The research also found that despite sustained economic hardship, including rising inflation and disrupted global supply chains, 96 per cent of SMEs who are already operating overseas, and 99 per cent of those planning to do so in the next twelve months, recorded growth last year. “Australians are innovators, and there is growing global demand for the products and services they provide,” added Sam. “We have seen this firsthand; Airwallex is the chosen partner to many Australian businesses looking to alleviate the global roadblocks associated with setting up shop in international markets, including opening accounts overseas, high FX fees and managing employee expenses. We see ourselves playing a central role in opening the door for Australian businesses to access borderless opportunities all around the world.” For SMEs trading overseas, the region where they have seen the biggest growth in sales and revenue was Southeast Asia. Almost two in five respondents (39 per cent) said this market had been their biggest generator of revenue outside of Australia in the past year, closely followed by the U.S. (29 per cent). These markets were echoed in terms of where the most beneficial prospects lie, with a quarter (26 per cent) of SMEs operating or planning to operate overseas identifying Southeast Asia as the most lucrative in the year ahead. The U.S. followed closely behind Southeast Asia, with 25 per cent of businesses with an international footprint or ambition naming the States out as the next most attractive market in the near future, surpassing China (18 per cent) and EMEA/UK (15 per cent).Case studiesSustainability sells – the reusable water bottle business sweeping the world upmemobottle is one Australian-founded business which is enjoying commercial success in overseas markets, with 50 per cent of its revenue now being generated abroad, mainly in the Southeast Asia region. In the past twelve months, the reusable water bottle movement has on-boarded distributors in Indonesia and Singapore, and exhibited at trade shows in the U.S. and Europe. memobottle Director and co-founder Jonathan Byrt cites the business’ focus on international markets as crucial to its success during the pandemic period. “Having a global presence during this tumultuous 24 months has allowed us to switch marketing and revenue focus between regions. Being in multiple markets unlocked opportunities for the business which have allowed us to grow and expand. Our operations in China and the U.S. kept our revenue steady while Australia and Europe battled with sustained lockdowns and geopolitical events,” said Jonathan.  “The majority of sales from a recent product launch (65 per cent) came from customers in the States. If we had all our eggs in one basket, this wouldn’t have been possible.”In orbit around the world – Orbitkey has their eyes on global dominanceMelbourne-founded Orbitkey has established a strong presence in the U.S. in recent years, which has become its dominant market above Australia, representing almost a third of its total sales (31 per cent). The business now has its sights on Asia, where it has a small but growing presence. For Orbitkey’s co-founder and Managing Director Rex Kuo, Orbitkey was always destined to scale beyond its home market.“As a product design company that prides itself on user-centred design and innovation, our products are designed for a global audience – not just Australians. We see great value and potential in the Asian market, where demand is growing exponentially from existing customers –- all of the signals are clear that expansion in this market looks lucrative,” said Rex.“It’s not just demand that makes Southeast Asia such an attractive business proposition. Cheaper and more competitive payment gateways are becoming more easily accessible than ever before, eliminating a large proportion of high transaction and currency conversion fees that were associated previously whilst doing B2C commerce in the region.” “We’re investing the revenue that was previously swallowed up by high transaction costs to maximise the opportunities for our growth in Southeast Asia, including locating a third-party logistics (3PL) in Hong Kong which has made shipping to countries in Asia cheaper than ever before.” “All of these components are coming together to make Southeast Asia one of the most dynamic business environments in the world. 9 per cent of our total sales come from the region as present but this will surpass into double digits in no time.”ENDNote to pressFor more insights, please find Airwallex’s Australian Business Growth Index report here.The Airwallex Australian Business Growth IndexThe Airwallex Australian Business Growth Index is the first edition of an annual series that takes the pulse of the Australian SME ecosystem.

With this increased capability, businesses with operations in Australia and New Zealand can easily collect payments from their customers, pay their suppliers and staff in both countries, as well as convert NZD to AUD (and vice versa) at market-leading rates, driving increased business growth opportunities between both markets.“Many of our Australian customers have expanded to New Zealand. Ensuring that these Australian businesses now have an efficient and cost-effective way to streamline their financial operations between the two countries can help them with their growth plans in the ANZ region,” Sam continued. Founded in 2015 in Melbourne, Airwallex is one of the fastest growing financial technology companies today, operating across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America today with over 1,200 employees in 19 major locations globally. The launch in New Zealand further strengthens Airwallex’s footprint in the APAC region, having announced an expansion into Singapore and Malaysia early this year, in addition to its presence in Hong Kong.Airwallex is a fully registered Financial Service Provider with the Financial Service Providers Register in New Zealand.—  END —

https://www.airwallex.com/newsroom/airwallex-extends-partnership-with-xero-increases-ease-and-speed-of-invoice,Airwallex extends partnership with Xero; increases ease and speed of invoice payments,"AUSTRALIA, 7 JUNE 2022 – Leading global fintech Airwallex has strengthened its long-term partnership with Xero with the launch of a new payment link integration for Xero invoices, increasing ease and speed of receiving invoice payments for Australian businesses. The solution also includes Airwallex’s multi-currency capabilities, allowing customers to issue and settle invoices in multiple currencies. Airwallex’s Australia-based customers that use Xero as their invoicing solution can now automatically embed an Airwallex payment link in their Xero invoice. The payment link enables them to collect funds from invoice recipients directly into their Airwallex account via cards and other local payment methods in over 170 currencies, and have their funds settled in eight currencies using a wide range of payment types. Once paid, funds will automatically reconcile to the invoice in Xero and a payment receipt email will be sent to the payer. Airwallex’s partnership with Xero started in 2020 when a bank feed integration was introduced between the two platforms. The new invoice integration is a pivotal addition as it synchronises the payment trail for Xero customers, from collections to bank feed reconciliation.“We are pleased to be extending our partnership with Xero to simplify accounting and bookkeeping for our customers. Invoice recipients can now pay in one click, increasing the speed and likelihood of getting paid for our customers, which in turn will improve their business cash flow. We’ve also brought our unique cross border payment capabilities to this solution to help our customers collect and hold in the currencies that are important to them, avoiding unnecessary conversion fees,” said Sam Kothari, Airwallex’s Head of Growth for ANZ.Airwallex launched its online payment acceptance capabilities last year, offering a suite of different integration methods, including payment links. These one-off or reusable links are instantly generated and issued for fast and seamless invoice payments, without the need for businesses to host payment services within their own website.

https://www.airwallex.com/newsroom/airwallex-partners-with-qantas-loyalty-to-expand-its-financial-services,Airwallex Partners with Qantas Loyalty to expand its financial services with ‘Business Money’ ,"AUSTRALIA, 22 FEBRUARY 2022 – Australia-founded global fintech Airwallex has been chosen by Qantas Loyalty as the technology partner for its new financial services offering, Qantas Business Money, aimed at making it easier for Australian companies to do business overseas while also allowing them to earn Qantas points.Qantas Business Money will be available in the second quarter of the year to more than 350,000 small and medium size businesses (SMEs) who are Qantas Business Rewards members. The technology will be powered by Airwallex. Airwallex Co-founder and CEO Jack Zhang said: “We are proud to be Qantas Business Rewards’ technology partner of choice for its new and innovative offering, Qantas Business Money.“This partnership is testament to the strength of our competitive global financial infrastructure that we’ve built over the last six years. Our platform empowers small businesses to operate globally without complexities and remove barriers to international expansion – it also enables larger organisations like Qantas to provide these same benefits to their customers through seamless integration. “We’re very excited to work together with one of the most iconic brands in Australia to continue to remove the constraints that Australian companies face in the current global financial system,” Mr Zhang added.Airwallex has regulatory approval to operate across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America, and upholds the highest regulatory and compliance standards in all the regions it operates in. Through Qantas Business Money, businesses will be able to access highly competitive foreign exchange rates that are up to 70 per cent less than the big banks; instantly set up local business accounts in 11 currencies; and use virtual Visa Business Debit cards to enable payments in local currencies. Qantas Business Rewards members will earn up to 25,000 bonus points after signing up and transacting with Qantas Business Money, as well as ongoing points everyday based on the volume of international foreign currency conversions at a rate of 1 point for every A$10 transacted. Qantas Loyalty CEO, Olivia Wirth said the partnership was integral to diversifying the Qantas Business Reward program’s financial services offer for members.“Earning Qantas Points on everyday business expenses is a real drawcard for the business owners in our program and helps them maximise the value they get from our program,” Ms Wirth said. “In partnership with Airwallex, we’ll be delivering a digital cross border payment platform that allows members to access extremely competitive foreign exchange rates and transact in local currencies when doing business offshore, all the while earning points. “The stunning growth of Airwallex shows there is huge demand for this from small to medium size businesses. “Australia’s love of earning Qantas Points has seen us build strong partnerships with some of the country’s biggest brands, as well as some of the most innovative. These connections are key to keeping our members engaged in the program and ultimately drive value for our business,” Ms Wirth added.Last year, Qantas trialled the technology with 170 businesses. Tony Nikro from freight forwarder Nikro Customs and Trade Services which does business in Asia, North America and Europe said the platform overcame challenges with traditional financial services which can be complex, slow and involve a lot of red tape. “Having the chance to trial this solution was valuable for my business. I’d never used anything like it before, it’s not set up like a bank or money transfer, which we’ve predominantly used in the past. Structurally, it was so different, it was quick, easy and much better value, plus, the potential to earn Qantas Points is incredibly appealing,” Mr Nikro said.Qantas Business Rewards lets members earn points on everyday business expenses including Qantas flights, hotels, petrol, insurance, technology and utilities. Members can also be rewarded across a range of financial services including business credit cards and business finance. Qantas Points earned from business expenses can be redeemed on leisure or business travel, Qantas Wine and in the Qantas Rewards Store, or to reward employees.Qantas Business Money is the latest financial services product to be launched by Qantas Loyalty. It follows Qantas Travel Money, home and personal loans, investment and wealth management solutions, savings accounts and credits cards. 35 per cent of all credit card transactions in Australia are made on a Qantas Points earning credit card, demonstrating the value frequent flyers put on earning points through financial products.How it will work:When it launches, existing Qantas Business Rewards members can apply to use Qantas Business Money Businesses who are not Qantas Business Rewards members can join free today via qantas.com/businessmoney or when signing up for Qantas Business Money.Once approved for Qantas Business Money users can: Begin making payments using multi-currency funds internationally through the account wallet, taking advantage of highly competitive foreign exchange rates that are just a fraction of the cost of traditional banking Instantly set up local business accounts in 11 currencies to enable fast transactions and more cost-effective transactionsQuickly and simply set up virtual Visa Business Debit cards linked to the account which can be used for online purchases.

Over two-thirds (69%) of respondents agree that businesses which don't take steps to cut down on unnecessary fees/charges around international trade are handicapping their growth.Indeed, the survey revealed that losses from card fees specifically could otherwise be put to better use enabling business growth:Three-quarters (75%) of UK SMEs would invest that freed-up budget back into their businessOne fifth (21%) would invest savings back into staffing17% would opt to invest in marketing, with the same figure opting to expand the product range Around one in ten (12%) would invest in facilities, e.g., office expansion UK SMEs show increased appetite for digital adoptionTwo-thirds (66%) of UK SME business decision makers believe that organisations which don't adapt their banking strategy for the digital age will struggle against competitors. For many, the visibility and transparency that a digital platform offers is key: 64% of respondents think businesses without a real-time view of expenses, transfers, and all other transactions to track are not firmly in control of their finances.While 7% of respondents have already moved all or the majority of their finances away from traditional banking to manage them on a digital fintech platform, a further 68% would consider doing this in future. In fact, more than two-fifths (44%) are considering doing this within the next 12 months.Jed Rose, GM, EMEA at Airwallex comments, “As businesses throughout the world have been impacted by the pandemic, more innovative, tech-driven strategies are giving them the opportunity to enhance their globalisation efforts. Whether it is the ability to open accounts in new markets within seconds, or combining all international payments into one platform for greater control and flexibility, identifying tech platforms that can enable end-to-end solutions which support business expansion across borders can facilitate sustainable future growth for businesses of all sizes.” ENDSMethodologyThis survey from Airwallex – carried out by Censuswide between 3rd-15th September 2021 – surveyed 500 business decision makers in UK SMEs (companies with 50-500 employees).About Airwallex Airwallex is a global payment platform with a mission to empower businesses of all sizes to grow without borders, and by doing so, contribute to the global economy.

This ethos is a key part of the product and engineering culture at Airwallex - from our leadership team to our internship program - and I hope this inspires talented engineers to forge their careers at Airwallex.“I am so proud of what we have achieved with our global financial infrastructure, and this award reinforces the excellence of our technology and innovation.

Outside of Australia, Airwallex has engineering hubs in San Francisco, Shanghai and the Netherlands.“Melbourne’s engineering hub has played a pivotal role in Airwallex, with many of our recent products beginning its development there, such as our core banking platform and multi-currency Visa debit cards. After witnessing the big impact our Melbourne team has had on the development of our platform and products, it was a no-brainer to open our fifth engineering hub in Sydney. This new hub allows us to invest in the growing tech talent pool in Sydney, which we look forward to welcoming to our team,” said Mr Zhang.ENDFor further information, please contact:AirwallexGina Daryanani, [email protected]Michelle Narayan, [email protected]About AirwallexAirwallex is a global fintech payment platform with a mission to empower businesses of all sizes to grow without borders, and by doing so, contribute to the global economy.

With the ability to transact in more than 140 currencies and make payments to merchants globally where Visa is accepted, the Airwallex Borderless Card will enable a more secure, transparent and fast way for businesses to make digital payments across borders. Both single use or multi-use cards are available with individual transaction limits across currency and merchant types, providing total control and visibility over payments. Looking ahead, the Airwallex Borderless Card will also expand to offer multi-currency corporate cards for business owners and their employees, further empowering them to make everyday corporate purchase decisions.A virtual card is a digital alternative to a physical payment card. It is created entirely online and is complete with a 16-digit number, card verification number and expiry date. Designed as a more secure and convenient way to make payments, virtual cards are essentially “card-less” card payments that allow the flexibility and control to make seamless payments in a matter of seconds.“Demand for virtual cards has been accelerating as businesses look for a modern solution to not only transact money, but to also control their finances, optimise spending and enhance their security and protection,” said Kai Wu, Greater China CEO and Group CFO of Airwallex. “As we continue to empower businesses to grow without borders, we are very excited to launch the Airwallex Borderless Card in Hong Kong in collaboration with Visa. The global accessibility and the ability for customers to transact in multiple currencies with this card further bolsters Airwallex’s product stack as we look to continuously enhance our offering, providing our customers with a one-stop shop for their cross-border payment needs.”Maaike Steinebach, General Manager, Visa Hong Kong and Macau said, “At a time of constant change, we are seeing a greater need for digital solutions to support businesses who operate globally. During the peak of the pandemic last year, 3 in 5 (61%) small and medium enterprises in Hong Kong were selling products online for the first time. As more businesses pivot to e-commerce and expand internationally, many demand for more secure and convenient ways to make cross-border payments. We are pleased to be partnering with Airwallex once again to launch the Airwallex Borderless Card in Hong Kong.”Airwallex and Visa first announced a strategic partnership in February 2020, with the aim to revolutionise the cross-border payments experience for businesses that need to make payments to multiple parties across different geographies. Airwallex and Visa debuted Airwallex Borderless Cards in Australia last year before rolling it out to the United Kingdom and now Hong Kong.ENDFor more information, please contact:AirwallexLiz Liang[email protected]VisaKinan Suchaovanich[email protected]About AirwallexAirwallex is a global fintech payment platform with a mission to empower businesses of all sizes to grow without borders, and by doing so, contribute to the global economy.

E-commerce sales in Hong Kong are forecasted to register a growth of 11.1% this year, and is expected to continue with this uptrend beyond the pandemic, driven by increasing demand for payment options that can provide improved security, greater efficiency and more customised solutions.

The entire end-to-end process for the merchants is made simpler, more cost-effective and quicker, while also ensuring the margins and fees are fully transparent.The introduction of Airwallex’s online card payments solution in Hong Kong follows the debut of the same service in the UK and Europe in September 2020, and is a further step towards building its own global, cloud-based online payments platform.

https://www.airwallex.com/newsroom/businesses-missing-the-benefits-of-fintech,"Businesses missing the benefits of fintech, say Airwallex and CPA Australia","MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA – 10 February 2021 - Global fintech unicorn Airwallex and Australia’s leading professional accounting body CPA Australia, launched the ‘The Role of FinTech in Modernising Businesses’ report today, which aims to educate businesses on emerging fintech solutions and drive fintech adoption.In August 2020, Airwallex and CPA Australia surveyed 600 CPA members working in finance and accounting across organisations in Asia Pacific (APAC) to evaluate the current state of fintech adoption. Based on the survey results, the report aims to address barriers to fintech adoption and help businesses understand the benefits of fintech solutions in modernising their business operations.Despite increasing digital adoption in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey revealed that only a third of businesses in the region have actively adopted fintech solutions. Additionally, a majority of businesses continue to have unmet business banking needs.Survey resultsAccording to the survey, businesses across APAC cited high banking fees (48 per cent), slow and manual service delivery (35 per cent) and the inability to set up global bank accounts (29 per cent) as the top pain points.Cybersecurity concerns top the list of reasons why businesses are yet to apply fintech solutions, with more than half (53 per cent) stating this is a key barrier for adopting tech solutions to manage their financial needs. This was closely followed by data privacy concerns (48 per cent), and reliability and trust (48 per cent).Summary of key findings70 per cent of APAC businesses surveyed have not used any fintech solutions40 per cent of APAC businesses are unaware of fintech and the benefits it offersHigh banking fees (48 per cent), slow and manual service delivery (35 per cent) and inability to set up global bank accounts (29 per cent) were cited as the top unmet needs by businesses48 per cent of respondents surveyed expressed cybersecurity, data privacy and trust concernsAustralia is leading APAC in familiarity and awareness of fintech benefits61 per cent of Australian CPA members surveyed having familiarity with the fintech options available for SME and enterprises (as compared with Hong Kong at 57 per cent, Malaysia at 56 per cent and Singapore at 54 per cent)Australia is leading APAC in fintech usage39 per cent of Australian-based CPA members surveyed have used at least one or more fintech (as compared with Hong Kong at 36 per cent, Singapore at 28 per cent and Malaysia at 20 per cent).QuotesNeil Luo, VP, Global Head of SME at Airwallex, said, “Fintech has transformed the global economy, creating new revenue streams and operating efficiencies so businesses large and small can remain viable in an increasingly competitive environment. However, today’s data shows low fintech adoption rates, highlighting a huge missed opportunity for businesses across the region in realising the benefits fintech has to offer. Many of the key business pain points - including opening accounts overseas, being charged high FX fees on foreign transactions and inability to issue employees with their own cards - can be alleviated or resolved through fintechs such as Airwallex.“At Airwallex, our digital payment solutions have enabled many businesses - from startups to large-scale enterprises - to grow in every corner of the world, while saving time and money doing so. We have earned our customers’ trust and confidence by ensuring that their transactions are not only fast and seamless but also secure. However, we understand education is key to greater fintech adoption, and look forward to working alongside CPA Australia in supporting accountants and the businesses they serve.” Luo continued.Gavan Ord, Manager Business and Investment Policy and Asia Policy Lead at CPA Australia, said, “Australian businesses are falling behind their international counterparts when it comes to the uptake of fintech solutions. The current business environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic has made digital technologies more essential than ever before.“Many of our members support clients who need help transforming into digital-first businesses. CPA Australia supports initiatives that encourage small businesses to undertake digital transformation.

https://www.airwallex.com/newsroom/airwallex-debuts-card-payment-acceptance-in-the-uk-and-europe,Airwallex debuts card payment acceptance in the UK and Europe to support surging ecommerce growth,"Airwallex’s new card payment acceptance product allows merchants to accept card payments from anywhere in the world whilst avoiding unnecessary foreign exchange feesThis new offering enables merchants to tap into a larger customer base to increase global ecommerce activity in light of COVID-19 impactLONDON, UNITED KINGDOM – 15 September 2020 – Global fintech leader Airwallex has launched its card payment acceptance solution in the United Kingdom and Europe allowing merchants to accept card payments around the world seamlessly and securely. The solution will initially support Visa and Mastercard card payments, with more payment methods planned.In the UK alone, ecommerce sales are expected to grow by 17.6% compared to last year in light of COVID-19. Airwallex has seen double digit revenue growth from its ecommerce customers in 2020, fuelled by the rapid acceleration of online spending globally. As businesses look further afield for growth opportunities, the importance of removing the unnecessary foreign exchange fees charged by banks and other payment providers has never been more critical. These fees are often hidden within inflated exchange rates, additional international payment fees, as well as auto-conversion by issuers and gateways at extremely poor rates.Airwallex’s card payment acceptance solution enables merchants to receive funds from anywhere in the world Visa and Mastercard are accepted – They can then hold these funds in Airwallex accounts in over 15 currencies, exchange currencies at the mid-market rate with a small transparent margin, and repatriate funds back to home markets with zero payment fees. This makes the process simpler, more cost-effective, and totally transparent for merchants.This new offering is a key part of Airwallex’s mission to support business growth with an end-to-end financial services platform. Now, merchants in the UK and Europe can access payments, collections, FX, and virtual global accounts in a single platform, and without the high fees that traditionally come with operating overseas. By working seamlessly with Airwallex’s platform to enable efficient management of multiple currencies, the new solution eliminates the need to work with multiple providers or to open bank accounts in different markets.The new card payment acceptance solution is aimed to go live in other key markets such as Australia and Hong Kong later this year.James Butland, VP of Global Banking said: “Ecommerce merchants today have access to many tech-driven ecommerce solutions that can help them easily set up and run their international operations. Existing cross-border financial services, which is a crucial part of this process, do not offer the same seamless experience. Merchants have to patch together different finance solutions to accept payments, repatriate funds from other markets and pay suppliers – these include payment gateways, business bank accounts in different markets, FX providers and remittance solutions. Managing these different solutions can be cumbersome and costly, and as a result, become a barrier to successful global expansion.”“With the introduction of our new card payment acceptance product Airwallex now offers everything a merchant needs to operate internationally in an end-to-end platform at the lowest cost. As ecommerce growth continues to accelerate Airwallex is committed to bringing products and services to market that help scale the digital economy and support businesses of all sizes in operating globally.”This announcement follows the Airwallex’s recent record US$160million Series D fundraising in April and is further evidence of the company’s commitment in the UK and mainland Europe, with plans to hire 50+ new talent in the region by 2021. This already includes Nigel Thacker, SVP Sales, who recently joined the London office and will take an instrumental role in expanding the European team alongside James Butland, VP of Global Banking. With more than 20 years of experience in the finance industry, Thacker was formerly SVP of Sales at Adyen and also worked for Vocalink, Barclays and RBS.Ready to scale your business with our business account?

https://www.airwallex.com/newsroom/airwallex-granted-emi-license-by-the-fca-sees-eu-cross-border-flows-growing,"Airwallex granted EMI license by the FCA, sees EU Growth","Airwallex, a global fintech leader with the vision to build financial infrastructure to scale the digital economy, has been granted an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The company was recently named by KPMG as one of the top 50 Global Fintech Companies of 2018, and the EMI license will further boost its growth by allowing operations throughout the EU by passporting through the region. Airwallex can then onboard clients across Europe countries, integrate with local banks to provide better financial infrastructure and provide payment services.Airwallex has also applied for the new virtual bank license in Hong Kong, which would allow it to build one of the first challenger banks in Asia and beyond. Asia is becoming one of the hottest markets for payments and Fintech, and Airwallex sees an unprecedented opportunity to build a digital bank that can more than replicate the success of Monzo, Revolut or N26 in Europe.The UK and Europe are high on Airwallex's list of priorities for international expansion, both on potential clients and access to world class talent. The company now plans to further expand its London office by the end of 2019, and sees existing pain-points insufficiently addressed by incumbent banks. The size of the global ecommerce market is forecasted to reach US$2.8tr this year and US$4.8tr by 2021. Serving these clients is a growing opportunity that Airwallex is looking to capitalize on, given the lack of efficient international payment solutions being offered.Research in 2016 revealed that SMEs in the U.K. are spending nearly GBP 4.5bil in hidden fees to their banks for cross-border payments across the Eurozone. A small business with 20 or so GBP 10000 international transactions a month, for example, would pay an average of more than GBP 2100 a month in fees, with a large portion paid in foreign exchange. On the other hand, Airwallex strives to offer transparent, competitive wholesale rates to businesses by utilizing its proprietary FX engine and global banking network, and currently support payments to over 130 countries and 50 currencies.Airwallex was co-founded in late 2015 by CEO Jack Zhang and four friends. ""We ordered lots of materials from overseas for the coffee shop we were running,"" he says.""One transaction was US$15,000 and we had to pay US$600 in foreign exchange fees. We said, this doesn't make sense. We can make foreign exchange much easier by innovating upon the underlying financial infrastructure.""About AirwallexAirwallex is a financial technology company redefining payments globally. In the span of 3 years, Airwallex has secured over $102M USD in external funding, supported by top-tier investors including tech giant Tencent, Sequoia Capital China and MasterCard. The company uses advanced technology to enable low-cost, high-speed and transparent international payments encompassing the entire cross-border payment value chain, from global collection to foreign exchange and international payments. Led by a highly capable, experienced, and driven executive team, Airwallex has established international offices across Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, Singapore, London and San Francisco.",newsroom

The company has now secured US$80 million from venture capital investment, taking their total fundraising to US$102 million.To close the Series B round, existing Series A investors Tencent and Sequoia China were joined by fellow China based Hillhouse, Sir Ka-Shing Li's Horizons Ventures from Hong Kong, Indonesia's Central Capital Ventura (BCA) and Australia's Square Peg, with whom Airwallex partnered in December for US$6m Series A+ funding.The new funding will accelerate the production of the smart, seamless cross-border payment technology that is effectively reimagining global payments. This level of funding success means significant global expansion, and a clear step forward to Airwallex realising their commitment to connecting every digital end-point in the world.COO and Co-Founder Lucy Liu explained, ""Airwallex has identified that businesses in all corners of the world are experiencing similar challenges as the pace and connectivity of a digitalised global economy continues to gain momentum. By offering full end to end solutions - not just in FX and payments - we're changing the way our clients thrive in the global arena.""Having already demonstrated considerable success within China, the spread of Airwallex's funding will see them solidify connections between APAC, Europe and North America. Adding to their dedicated entities in Melbourne, Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Shanghai; Airwallex will now extend to North America, and Canada - becoming a true global force in their target industries and verticals. Tencent and Sequoia China have demonstrated a strong confidence in the company's ability to change the way the world does business with China, again participating in Airwallex's fundraising.Sequoia China Founding and Managing Partner Neil Shen said, ""As the pace and connectivity of the digitalized global economy continues to rapidly accelerate, the need to focus on foreign exchange and payments has become critically important for large corporates and SMEs. We believe that Airwallex's continuous improvement in providing seamless solutions for this problem is eliminating the obstacle, effectively giving their clients a clear advantage in a hyper competitive global market.""A notable portion of funds will be put towards encouraging financial inclusion for SMEs in the Hong Kong market, where Airwallex will apply for a Virtual Banking licence to support and empower the fintech ecosystem globally. Funding will also support growth in the UK, where despite Brexit, Airwallex sees growth opportunities, especially supporting those companies doing business and accelerating connections with China and Southeast Asia.At home, and with a broader level of awareness, Airwallex will use the Series B funding to seed the go-to-market for a new product suite. The product offering will solve the pain felt by Australian SME's who are trying to grow internationally but hit sizeable barriers around payments and foreign exchange.""Airwallex wants to support Australian businesses with awesome financial products,"" Lucy says. ""In providing these solutions, we intend to shake up the industries we're playing in. We're creating a better, more cost effective one-stop-shop solution using technology delivered here in Australia.""""Our end game is to provide the global network required for businesses to scale globally and to take advantage of the digital and online opportunities that exist when you're transacting in multiple markets.""Built to bolster foreign exchange payments around the world, the Airwallex platform is powered by a sophisticated FX and payment engine and a transparent pricing model to avoid inflated margins and minimise market risk.

On a personal level, this award is also important because fintech is still largely a male-dominated field. I think an important way that I can support other women is to be a beacon for them. This means grasping at every opportunity that comes my way in my own professional life, and being an active member of the fintech community. We have some astonishing women working in fintech, and I am glad to be a part of that.""""Regardless of gender, an entrepreneur isn't someone who owns a business, it's someone who makes things happen - and I like to think of myself as that person. Sometimes being a female makes it a more challenging experience, but being an entrepreneur is about making the commitment that others won't, being prepared to take a chance, and having the confidence to back yourself up.”Lucy’s award win comes hot on the heels of her Co-Founder Jack Zhang’s recent win at China’s Brilliant10 Awards where he took home the award in the coveted FinTech category.Starting life as a group of five friends, Airwallex recently hired its 100th employee and opened a new office in Shanghai.

The rebrand comes as the international payments company strengthens its commitment to the Asian region, beginning with a key presence at Money 20/20 Asia.Reflecting the pace and nimble nature of the company, Airwallex's new branding will officially launch at the event, featuring across all collateral. With offices already in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore, Airwallex's strong brand presence makes their message at this year's Money 20/20 very clear - they are putting down firm roots in Asia.Airwallex's suite of APIs, which allow businesses to process international payments at scale, will be front at centre across the event, and the company's Co-Founder and COO Lucy Lui will give a keynote presentation at the event. Her session on How to get rapid growth for your start up in Asia is already attracting attention from the likes of CNBC Asia, and her insight is a highly anticipated component of an impressive speaking line-up. Lucy will discuss her own business experiences and strategies for success in the largely misunderstood markets of Asia. She will shine a light on how Airwallex has tackled the region which has traditionally been perceived as 'too hard' given the country by country nuances of the corridor.Already aligned with China's gargantuan export WeChat Pay, Airwallex intends to strengthen its position within Asia during Money 20/20. As evidenced by Lucy's highly anticipated presentation, and the brand's presence at Money 20/20, growth of the Airwallex brand is the #1 priority for the business, and the company is unapologetic in regards to its aggressive targeting of the Asian market.Airwallex's CEO Jack Zhang will also be speaking on-site, taking part in a panel session and discussing the business' opportunity to scale not only their own operations, but that of their partners. Somewhat of a 'dream factory', Airwallex's offering assists businesses to accelerate their growth by removing the payment barriers that can potentially stall global growth. Dedicated to creating beautiful customer experiences, Jack will highlight Airwallex's focus on end-to-end cross border solutions for partners, and how their relationships with the likes of Tencent provides another level of support and growth opportunity.Built to bolster foreign exchange payments around the world, the Airwallex platform is powered by a sophisticated FX and payment engine and a transparent pricing model to avoid inflated margins and minimise market risk.

Adding funds to your wallet via Bank Transfer
","
Your Wallet is the main store of funds in your account, and provides valuable information about the funds you hold and your recent transaction history. Your account will include Wallets for each currency that you hold with Airwallex.
 
There are two main ways to add funds to your wallet:

By using the ‘Add funds’ feature on your Wallet page (2 - 3 business days) or bank transfer via your Global Account details
By direct debit from an existing bank account by linking it to Airwallex (note: only Australia is supported at this stage, this deposit takes 2 - 5 business days to arrive)

The above are estimated timelines for your funds to settle in your wallet and will depend on your own bank and the currency you fund your Wallet with. In countries where Airwallex has integrated with local payment networks, your funds may be available sooner.
 
Need your funds to settle faster or funds haven’t arrived? Please reach out to our Support Team here.

","
This article answers questions about when you can create conversions and how often they are settled. - When can I make a conversion?- What is a spot date?- Can I settle my conversion on an earlier or later date than I originally booked?- Why can I not settle my conversions on some dates?
When can I make a conversion?
Conversions can be made whenever you need to throughout the day. At times where there is low or no liquidity in FX markets, such as weekends, bid/ask spreads may be wider than during market hours.
What is a spot date?
Typically, the Spot Date in Foreign Exchange is a settlement date that is two business days into the future.
The majority of currency pairs will calculate the spot date as Today + 2 available business days, however, there are a few exceptions ie USD, CAD which has a spot date of Today + 1 available business day.
Can I settle my conversion on an earlier or later date than I originally booked?
No, you'll need to settle any conversion booked with Airwallex on the date you specified when booking the conversion.
Why can I not settle my conversions on some dates?
Central Banks don't usually operate their clearing systems on weekends or local public holidays. This ultimately stops the movement of money during these periods.

Two-factor Authentication
","
What is Two-factor authentication (2FA)?
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used to protect the safety of your online account and cards. It ensures that people trying to access an online account or making a card transaction are who they say they are.
To begin with, a user will enter their username and password as the first factor. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide an authentication code generated by the device they physically possess as the second factor.
Airwallex supports 2 primary methods to generate authentication codes:

Text Message (SMS) One-Time-Password (OTP)
Mobile Authenticator App

With 2FA, a potential compromise of only your login details will not unlock the account so your account and cards are more secure.
 
Two-factor authentication on your Airwallex account
1. How can I enable 2FA for my account?
Account owners and admins (or any user with edit permission for settings) can enable Account-wide two-factor authentication in Settings > Security. To change settings it is required for the user to set up 2FA first.

All users using this account will be asked to set up 2FA the next time they next log in. For certain jurisdictions 2FA is mandatory for every user and cannot be turned off.
 
2. How do I set up my 2FA?
You can set up your 2FA by following the instructions on the setup pages.

If you are new to Airwallex, you can start the 2FA setup at your first login
If you are an existing customer, you can set up your 2FA at User profile > Security > Two-factor authentication



 
3. Which authenticator should I use?
You can set up either an SMS or App based authenticator. The use of both authenticators is for free*.
For authentication apps, we recommend the following:

Google Authenticator
Symantec VIP

Both authenticator apps can be easily installed on your phone. Once set up, they are accessible even without an internet connection.
* Your carrier may charge for SMS messages or mobile data
 
4. What are the Recovery codes?
In the event that you cannot receive the text message code or access your authenticator app, you can use one of the 10 recovery codes for the 2FA verification. Each recovery code is valid for one-time use only.
The first 10 recovery codes will be generated once your 2FA is set up successfully. From here you can:

Print your recovery codes and store them in a safe place
Re-generate 10 new recovery codes in User profile > Security > Two-factor authentication > Recovery codes - show > Generate new recovery codes. This will deactivate your old codes.


 
5. Have trouble logging in with 2FA?
If you cannot use the SMS code or the authenticator app to log in, one of the 10 recovery codes can be used for the 2FA verification.
If you don't have your recovery codes, please reach your Account Manager or our Customer Support team for help. After our team has your details verified, your 2FA will be reset. (Please note: You cannot reset your 2FA by Email or SMS)
 
6. Can I deactivate my 2FA or skip 2FA setup?
You can deactivate your 2FA if your Account does not force all users to set-up 2FA. You can check and deactivate under User profile > Security > Two-factor authentication.
 
7. Can I choose to have my device remembered so that I don't have to keep doing 2FA every time I login?
If you're using the WebApp, then yes, you can! Simply check the box to have your device remembered for 48 hours.

If you're using the iOS or Android app, unfortunately this feature is not available yet.
 
8. Can I reset my own 2FA?
Yes, you can reset/ edit the 2FA by yourself if you are logged in under User Profile > Security > 2FA authentication method  > Edit.

 
Two-factor authentication on your card payments
Airwallex also supports 2FA on card transactions, also known as 3D Secure, or 3DS.
1. What is 3DS?
3DS is a security protocol used by merchants and issuers worldwide as an extra layer of security to ensure a purchase is from the rightful owner of the card. 
The additional 3DS step typically will prompt the shopper at the checkout step to enter a verification code sent to their mobile or email. The prompt will present itself with card networks’ brand names, like Visa secure and the card issuer’s logo. 
Example of 3DS flow:

The cardholder enters their card details
Airwallex will assess the request and decide if additional 3DS authentication by the cardholder is required at this step
If required, you'll be asked to complete the additional authentication step
Enter the OTP in the corresponding box and complete the authentication step

2. How is 3DS affecting you as an Airwallex customer?
As an Airwallex cardholder, you may be prompted to input a verification code for certain types of online payments before you can complete the checkout process on the merchant website. You'll have the option to receive the code via your email or phone number on file with Airwallex.
3DS is only used for online transactions, and only if the merchant supports it too. When a 3DS authentication request is triggered by the merchant, Airwallex will send you the verification code based on your chosen method (email or SMS). 
To ensure a smooth transaction experience, we recommend keeping your mobile and email address with us up-to-date. This will help us contact you correctly if authentication is required. 
You can update your cardholder information via the update cardholder API or in the WebApp in your profile 
 
For UK & EEA based cardholders: 
The Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulation (a new set of standards proposed under PSD2 by the European Banking Authority in order to enhance security of payment service across the EU) in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK mandates the use of 3D Secure (3DS) for online card payments. 3DS can be optional in other parts of the world but can still be used as a tool to help reduce fraud. 
In order to comply with the SCA requirements, any cardholders must have a mobile on file with Airwallex before creating or using EEA/UK cards. 
In other regions, cardholders can have either email or mobile on file to enroll in 3DS.

Airwallex only offers Business Accounts at this time, and cannot provide accounts to individuals for personal use. Due to different restrictions and regulations, there are a few limitations on the types of businesses and transactions we can support. Please see below to better understand if we can support your business. 
Can I open a personal account?
No, at this time Airwallex is only for Businesses. Our accounts are strictly for the purpose of business transactions where goods or services are sold, either to a business or an individual.
Where can my business be located?
You can see our full list of supported countries here. 
Can I apply if I am a citizen of Russia or Belarus?
Russian and Belarusian citizens can certainly apply for an Airwallex business account as long as you have a registered business. However, we can't yet onboard businesses registered in Russia or Belarus just yet.
As a global business providing financial services, we will continue to comply with all applicable economic sanctions laws that are legally binding upon the business.
Which business industries are supported? 
Certain business types are restricted from using Airwallex due to government regulations and/or increased risk of money laundering and terrorism financing. These include but are not limited to investment firms, arms dealers, gambling companies, pharmaceutical companies and charities. 
To see the full list, please see our Terms & Policies by region. 
If your business or the nature of your transactions does not fall under the above categories, we'd love to hear from you - get in touch with us to let us know!

How does the Airwallex connection to Xero work? 
","
When you connect your Xero account to Airwallex, you give Airwallex permission to send transactions to your Xero account.  A bank feed will be created in Xero for each currency balance you connect. 
The first sync will pull in the transactions from the last 24 hours, and going forward your transactions will sync to Xero hourly. 
What is a sync or bank feed?
Airwallex pushes our customers’ transaction data to their connected Xero account every hour. This is called a sync. So your Airwallex transactions for each currency sync hourly to Xero. All these synced transactions are referred to as bank feeds in Xero. 
The bank feeds are any transactions that affect your Airwallex wallet balance, including deposits via global accounts, conversions, payouts, card transactions, adjustments. Each wallet has its own stream of bank feeds in Xero based on the currency of the transaction. 
You can NOT, however, create separate bank feeds in Xero for individual global accounts or cards. This is because there is no start and end balance/credit in our global accounts or virtual/physical cards, they act only as a gateway for fund flow.

How will deposits, conversions, transfers and card transactions show up in Xero? 
DepositsDeposits via your Global Account will sync through to Xero as ""received"" showing Transaction Date, Reference, Description, Transaction Amount and Transaction Type, see example below:

ConversionsConversions performed in your Airwallex account will sync through to Xero as ""spent"" OR ""received"" depending on the currency pair combination and which currency balances you have connected showing Transaction Date, Description, Transaction Amount and Transaction Type, see example below:


TransfersTransfers performed in your Airwallex account will sync through to Xero as ""Spent"" showing Transaction Date, Payee, Reference, Description, Transaction Amount and Transaction Type, see example below:


CardsCard Transactions made via your Airwallex account will sync through to Xero as ""Spent"" showing Transaction Date, Reference, Description, Transaction Amount and Transaction Type.
The Reference will include the Company name for Company cards or the Employee cardholder name for Employee cards, as well as the last 4 digits of the card number (this can assist you in setting up rules in Xero to automatically code certain card transactions to specific GL codes, see more information about setting up rules in Xero here). 
Please see the example below:


Card Transactions using Convert and Pay feature
Card transactions that auto convert from another balance in the wallet will pull from the wallet balance of the default currency. For example, if a transaction is incurred in HKD on a card and the HKD balance in your wallet is empty or insufficient, the card will pull from your selected default currency. The same fields as regular card transactions will be populated in Xero.
See our article: What is the automatic conversions for cards? to learn how to change your default currency. 
See example below of HKD transaction drawing from AUD wallet balance:

Airwallex says my Xero account isn’t connected, why is this?
","
If your account is not connecting, this may be because you have disconnected your account from the Xero side, or your account connection has failed.
If you wish to reconnect, simply disconnect from the Airwallex side and go through the connection set-up again.

Why do I only see one currency option to connect to Xero? 
","
If you only see the option to connect one currency to Xero this is likely because your Xero account isn’t premium (multi-currency). If you wish to connect multiple currencies to Xero, upgrade your account in Xero. Please note, you may need to disconnect on the Airwallex side and reconnect to reflect the changed Xero account type.

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA): Under an agreement between Australia and the United States, and under Australian law, financial institutions collect tax residency information about United States citizens and tax residents.

About Financial Institutions
Financial Institution (FI): Holds or invests cash and Financial Assets for others, and sometimes for themselves.

Includes Depository Institutions, Custodial Institutions, Specified Insurance Companies, Managed Investment Entities (which include trusts in certain circumstances) and other Investment Entities.

Under FATCA, non-US FIs are called ‘Foreign Financial Institutions’ (FFIs).

Entities may also be FIs if they’re managed or controlled by another FI that has responsibility and power to make and carry out investment decisions for them e.g. a trust may be a FI, if a trustee is a FI and that trustee invests or manages the trust’s property without needing prior approval from other trustees.

Depository Institution: Accepts monetary deposits in the ordinary course of banking or similar business.
Custodial Institution: Holds customers’ securities, physically or electronically, for safekeeping and isn’t engaged in traditional banking.
Specified Insurance Company: An insurance company, or its holding company, that issues or must pay under a cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract.
Managed Investment Entity (MIE): An entity that: (i) in the past three financial years or if shorter, the period since the entity has been trading, earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing or trading in Financial Assets and (ii) is managed or controlled by another FI that has responsibility and power to make and carry out investment decisions for them. For example, a trust may be a managed Investment Entity, if a trustee is a FI and that trustee invests or manages the trust’s property without needing prior approval from other trustees.
Investment Entity: Primarily trades, invests, administers or manages Financial Assets (including individual and collective portfolios of Financial Assets) on behalf of its customers.
Financial Assets: Includes shares, debt securities, commodities, and derivative financial instruments, e.g. interest rate swap or foreign currency forward contracts. Does not include a non-debt direct interest in real property.

How is the foreign exchange rate calculated?
","
Please read below to understand how the Airwallex exchange rate is calculated, what the interbank rate is and when you will receive your rate confirmation.
How is the foreign exchange rate calculated?
Airwallex has integrated with a number of financial institutions (including liquidity providers) around the world that provide pricing and execution services to Airwallex.
Airwallex calculates the foreign exchange rate used based on a wide variety of factors including available liquidity in the market, available prices from liquidity providers, other market conditions and agreed upon sales margins.
Confirmation of the foreign exchange rate used in any conversion is provided immediately after a foreign currency transaction.
For customers accessing our LockFX solution, the foreign exchange rate used will equal the LockFX rate active at the time of the transaction.
What is the interbank rate?
Given the nature of foreign exchange markets, there is no single interbank rate. Our interbank rate is determined by us having reference to live exchange rates from our banking partners and market data sources, and then calculating a blended rate from those sources. The blended rate may involve calculating the weighted average of one or more exchange rates available to us.
We don't include a markup specific to you in the interbank rate. However, foreign exchange markets generally only operate 5 days per week, Monday to Friday. During the weekend, and other times when markets are closed or where rates are unavailable to us, an additional markup may be applied to our interbank rate to account for such situations.

Transfer Approval User Guide
","
About this user guide
This guide will take you through the steps required to utilise the Transfer Approval feature on the Airwallex Web App platform. 
What is Transfer Approval? 
Transfer Approval is a four-eye check mechanism that allows you to put in place controls around which your team members can create and approve a transfer. The creator is responsible for creating a transfer draft, while the approver checks and approves the transfer draft. 
How do I set it up?
The setting is not currently available in the Airwallex Web App, and you will need to contact our support team to enable it for your account(s).
Setting up Transfer Approval roles and users
Once the feature is enabled, you can assign different roles to users within the User Access Management under Account. 
With Transfer Approval disabled, the system role “analyst” and “admin” both allow a user to create a transfer. You can also set up new customized roles. Any user with the “Create, Edit, View” permissions is able to create a transfer. 
With Transfer Approval enabled, the system role “analyst” allows a user to submit a transfer for approval, and the system role “admin” allows a user to both submit a transfer for approval and approve a transfer.
You can also set up new customised roles. Any user with the “Create, Edit, View” permissions is able to submit a transfer for approval, any user with the “Approve” permission can approve, and any user with the “Create, Edit, View, Approve” permission can submit a transfer for approval and approve. 

 

Creating a transfer draft
Users with “Create, Edit, View” or “Create, Edit, View, Approve” permissions can submit transfers for approval.

Select the ‘Transfers’ tab
Click the “New Transfer” button
Choose an existing recipient or “send to someone new”
Enter the transfer details


5. Review the transfer request, and submit it for approval. Or, if you are a user with the “Create, Edit, View, Approve” permissions, you can create the transfer.

6. If you selected to submit for approval, you can find your created draft in the “Drafts” tab
7. If you selected to create the transfer, you can find it in the “Summary” tab
Recalling a transfer draft for modification or deletion 
Creators can remove a draft from approval by recalling the draft. The recalled draft can be deleted or recreated by “modifying” the request.

Select the “Transfers” tab
Select the “Drafts” tab
Find the draft you want to review and recall as needed


4. You can modify or delete the draft as needed afterward

Reviewing (approve/reject) a transfer draft
Users with “Approve” permissions can approve or reject transfer drafts.

Select the “Transfers” tab
Select the “Approvals” tab
Find the draft you want to review and reject/approve as needed

How do I dispute a card transaction?
","
You may want to dispute a transaction for a few different reasons.

You've found unrecognised transactions on your card
You've paid for goods or services that you haven't received

 
If you've found unrecognised transactions on your account
Step 1. Freeze your card
Freeze or cancel your card to prevent any further transactions being made on it.
- Freeze your card
- Permanently cancel your card
Step 2. Investigate the transactions
Once your card has been frozen, there are a few things you can do to check if the transactions were fraudulent:
1. Ask your team - check if they were made by someone who may be authorised to use the card
2. Research the business - find out if the business could be trading under a different name. You can check by Googling the name, doing an ABN search (for AUS) or a Companies house search (for UK)
If you find that the transactions were authorised, you can unfreeze your card easily in the same way you froze it. Simply click 'Unfreeze' instead.
Step 3. Raise a transaction dispute
If you can't figure out who made the transactions, the next step is to raise a dispute.
You can do this by filling in the form below, and our Risk team will get back to you within 1 working day.
Raise a transaction dispute
 
If you've paid for goods or services that you haven't received

Things to know before you raise a transaction dispute
We do our best to recover your payments, however in some circumstances we will not be able to recover your funds. These include but are not limited to:
- Refunds or exchanges
- Membership or subscription questions 
- Issues with defective or unsatisfactory products or services
Any transaction you wish to dispute, we strongly encourage you to contact the business in order to resolve the issue first. These issues may be resolved with the business directly:
- Duplicate charges
- Cancelled a subscription but was still charged
- Don't receive the product
There is a time limit!
Most card disputes must be lodged within 90 days of the transaction.

What is the automatic conversions for cards?
","
 
What is the automatic conversion for cards?Automatic conversions use your home currency^ to help prevent card payments from failing. If you have insufficient funds to complete a card purchase in 1 of the 10 currencies listed below, we will use the available funds in your home currency. The 10 currencies: AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NZD, SGD, USD
We will first check if funds are available in your purchase currency's balance. If not, we will check whether your home currency's balance can cover the entire purchase amount. If it can, we will deduct it from your home currency balance at the prevailing FX rate.Please note that we will use funds available in one currency only.

Examples of Card Purchases:
Rachael has $50 USD and $150 AUD in her wallet balance and her home currency is AUD. At the time she makes the card transaction, the exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.50 AUD.
 

Examples of Card Refunds
In the event where your card purchase is refunded by the merchant and the purchase was in 1 of the 10 currencies (AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NZD, SGD, USD), the refund will be credited in the purchase currency. In all other situations, the refund will be automatically converted back to your home currency.


^ The local currency in the country where your business is located. E.g. AUD for Australia, GBP for the UK.* Actual amount may vary depending on the exchange rate at the time of refund.

How to set up your employee with an Airwallex card?

This guide will walk you through how to set up your employee with an Airwallex card. Head here to check out more articles about Cards. 
Navigate to the ‘Cards’ tab on your Airwallex Webapp

Select ‘Create card’

Select ‘Employee card’ 

Select the employee you would like to create a card for. If you have not invited the  employee to your account previously, then click the ‘Invite a new user’ button to invite the new user to the account and enter their basic details. 

Enter the email and name of the employee you would like to invite. We’ll send them an email invitation with prompts on how to get started. To protect your account, this email invitation will expire in 14 days. If this is the first card you are creating for this employee, you will be prompted to provide their full legal name as found on their government-issued documents.

Set any spending limits on the card. You can set daily, weekly, monthly limits, or an all-time limit on the card.

If you would like to order a physical card for this employee, please input the shipping address. If you've chosen to keep this card virtual, you will not be able to convert or order a physical copy in the future. Instead, you can simply order a new dedicated physical card for your employee instead. You are able to add virtual cards to Apple Pay or Google Pay if it is available in your region. See here for more information. 
Once complete, click ‘Create card’.

In order to use the card, the employee will need to verify their personal details. They will be sent an email with instructions on how to login and verify their personal details. Alternatively, you can provide this information on their behalf by clicking ‘Provide information’. The physical card will be shipped once their information is verified.

You are able to view a list of all employees and their cards from the ‘Employee Cards’ tab under the Cards section. Once an employee has submitted their details, the employee status will change to ‘Verified’ and the card is ready for use. 
Note, for security reasons, only the employee can see the full details of their card.

Bug Bounty Program Rules
","
Airwallex is committed to building a strong relationship with the information security community. In order to reward the best external contributions that help us keep our users safe, we maintain a Bug Bounty Program for Airwallex owned web properties.Starting from 13/07/2021 The Airwallex bug bounty program is invite only, issues submitted to bugbounty@airwallex.com will be handled based on priority.
 
Services in scope
Any Airwallex owned web service that handles reasonably sensitive user data is intended to be in scope. This includes virtually all the content in the *.airwallex.com domain.
 
Qualifying vulnerabilities
Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data is likely to be in scope for the program. The program is limited to technical vulnerabilities in Airwallex owned / used web applications. 
Please do not attempt to carry out DoS or DDoS attacks, social engineering, spamming or do other similarly questionable things.
 
The following finding types are specifically excluded from the bounty
 
- The use of automated scanners is strictly prohibited.
- Disclosure of known public files or directories, (e.g. robots.txt).
- Clickjacking and issues only exploitable through clickjacking.
- CSRF on forms that are available to anonymous users (e.g. the contact form).
 - CSRF attacks that require knowledge of the CSRF token (e.g. attacks involving a local machine).
- Logout Cross-Site Request Forgery (logout CSRF).
- Content Spoofing.
- Login or Forgot Password page brute force and account lockout not enforced.
- OPTIONS HTTP method enabled.
- Username / email enumeration.
- Missing HTTP security headers, specifically (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers), e.g.
   - Strict-Transport-Security.
   - X-Frame-Options.
   - X-XSS-Protection.
   - X-Content-Type-Options.
   - Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Security-Policy, X-WebKit-CSP.
   - Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only.
   - Cache-Control and Pragma
- HTTP/DNS cache poisoning.
- SSL/TLS Issues, e.g.
   - SSL Attacks such as BEAST, BREACH, Renegotiation attack.
   - SSL Forward secrecy not enabled.
   - SSL weak/insecure cipher suites.
- Self-XSS reports will not be accepted.
   - Similarly, any XSS where local access is required (i.e. User-Agent Header injection) will not be accepted. The only exception will be if you can show a working off-path MiTM attack that will allow for the XSS to trigger.
- Missing or incorrect SPF records of any kind.
- Missing or incorrect DMARC records of any kind.
- Source code disclosure vulnerabilities.
- Information disclosure of non-confidential information
- Email bombing/flooding/rate limiting
 
Non-qualifying vulnerabilities
Depending on their impact, some of the reported issues may not qualify if they do not present a considerable amount of risk to the business.
 
Reward amounts for security vulnerabilities
Our monetary rewards are loosely consistent with other known reward programs and the final amount is always chosen at the discretion of our reward panel. In particular, we may decide to pay higher rewards for unusually clever or severe vulnerabilities or pay lower rewards for vulnerabilities that require unusual user interaction. We may also decide a single report actually constitutes multiple bugs or that multiple reports are so closely related that they only warrant a single reward. Airwallex rewards bug bounty hunters on a first-come, first-served basis - the first comprehensive report for the same bug will be awarded any bounty.
 
Investigating and reporting bugs
When investigating a vulnerability, please only ever target your own accounts. Never attempt to access anyone else's data and do not engage in any activity that would be disruptive or damaging to the users or to Airwallex.
Please bear in mind we are interested in bugs, not user data. If you come across user information during the course of your research, do not save, store, copy, transfer, disclose, or otherwise retain this information and please report it immediately to us.
Note that we are only able to answer technical vulnerability reports. Non-security bugs and queries about problems with your account should be instead directed to our customer support team.
Please perform your research in good faith. Please don’t publicly disclose a vulnerability without our consent and review. Our pledge to you is to respond promptly and fix bugs in a sensible timeframe - and in exchange, we ask for a reasonable advance notice. Reports that go against this principle will usually not qualify, but we will evaluate them on a case-by-case basis.
 
Legal points
We are unable to issue rewards to individuals who are on sanctions lists, or who are in countries (e.g. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) on sanctions lists. You are responsible for any tax implications depending on your country of residency and citizenship. There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon your local law.
This is not a competition, but rather an experimental and discretionary rewards program. You should understand that we can cancel the program at any time and the decision as to whether or not to pay a reward has to be entirely at our discretion. Airwallex rewards bug bounty hunters on a first come, first served basis so if you find a vulnerability that has just been reported we will not reward you.
Of course, your testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.
To contact our information security team, please email bugbounty@airwallex.com.

I have questions about the settlement of funds using Online Payments
","
What is a settlement? 
Settlement refers to the deposit of funds accrued on the Online Payments product into your bank account. Note that the settlement will be net of any fees. 
How long does settlement take? 
Settlement takes 2-3 business days depending on the card scheme (Visa & Mastercard). Your settlement may also be impacted by the reserve requirements you have received by Airwallex. For example T+4 day settlement means that you will receive your funds (less Airwallex fees) into your wallet by Day 4. 
For more information about reserves please refer to the following link.
What does settlement look like? 
To make it easier for you, Airwallex will settle into your wallet in the different settlement currencies. Please note that we will settle in batches and not on a transaction basis.
How do I access settlement reports? 
Airwallex provides you with all the details necessary to understand your settlements. To do so access ‘Wallet’ and you can export settlement reports which include full details on payments, refunds, disputes and fees. 
More details on settlement reports can be found here.
What currencies do transactions settle in? 
Transactions will settle in a range of currencies depending on a number of factors such as region, payment method and your nominated default settlement currency.
On Visa and Mastercard transactions for Australian merchants, Airwallex provides like-for-like settlement for 7 currencies. This includes AUD, USD, HKD, EUR, GBP, SGD and JPY.
Full details on settlement currencies by payment methods can be found here.

There are four main places you can see all your payments across all Payment Links, Xero Invoicing, Online Payments or Shopping Platform Integrations (e.g. Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento:

In your Xero settlement bank feed integration
In your WebApp, under ‘Payments’ and ‘Payment activity’
In your WebApp, under ‘Wallet’ and ‘Transactions’ as batched settlements
As a report or export, under ‘Reports’ and ‘Settlement Report’

See also: How to understand and reconcile your Online Payments fees

This feature is currently in beta, get early access by signing up here.
Under ‘Connections’, you will see a dedicated Xero Online Payments connection option. This dedicated feed provides more information for each payment to Xero for easier reconciliation - such as individual line items for each payment amount, fee and reserves.

2) In your WebApp, under ‘Payments’ and ‘Payment activity’
Under the ‘Payment Activity’ tab you are able to see all payments across all integration methods (e.g. payment links, shopping extension, API) - including failed, refunded, disputed and more.

You can click into each individual payment to see further details including the total captured amount, fees, amount pending settlement or reserve holds.
You can also export all the payment activity data into a .xlsx for further analysis.

3) In your WebApp, under ‘Wallet’ and ‘Transactions’
You will see all pending and settled payments in your wallet transactions, with a breakdown of the amount, fees, reserve and net amount.
A batch settlement is a combination of multiple payments on the same settlement cycle. For example if there are 5 payments that happen on the same day, all 5 payments will be batched into a single batch settlement.
See here for more information about how your payout and settlement timeframes work.

For settled transactions, you can download a settlement report with further information.

4) As a report or export, under ‘Reports’ and ‘Settlement Report’
When exporting a settlement report, you can see the detail of all payments, refunds, disputes, fees across your transactions.
Settlement reports will also include the Batch ID to help reconcile with the wallet transactions.

For employees / cardholders
Account Admins can order a physical card for you, so please ask an Admin on your account to create a physical card for you.
For Admins
To create a physical card for your employees or yourself, simply follow these steps:
Step 1. Click the 'Cards' section of your account, then 'Create a new card'

Step 2. Select 'Employee card'
We’re currently only offering physical cards for employee cards.

Step 3. Select an existing user from the list or click ‘Invite new user’. Once you’ve invited them, they’ll appear in your list for you to select. Click ‘Next’.
If you’re inviting a new user, you don’t need to wait for them to sign up, you can create a card for them straight away!

Step 4. Choose whether you’d like to verify your employee’s ID and personal information on their behalf, or let them do it.
We generally recommend selecting ‘Let employee complete’, as they know their information best!
For example. The name you input must match the name on their ID. This can sometimes differ from the name they prefer to be called around the office!
Step 5. Choose a delivery address.
You can choose between your registered business address, your employee's address (if you have it on file), or a different address altogether.
The only addresses we aren't able to accept at the moment are PO Boxes.
You also have the option not to create a physical card at all, and to just create a virtual card. Every physical card also comes with an attached virtual card.
Step 6. Set your spending limits
Step 7. Review and click ‘Create card’
What happens next?

'Sign up to Airwallex' email. If they're a new user on your Airwallex account, they'll receive an email asking them to set up their Airwallex account and login details. They should do this first. The link in this invitation will expire after 24 hours, but you can reset it here.
'You have a new card' email. They'll also receive a second email notifying that you’ve created a card for them.
Submit their ID. If it's their first card, they'll be required to submit their ID. They can do this by following the link in their email or logging into their Airwallex account. They'll then need to wait for our team to verify their ID, which they'll do it as quickly as possible.
Use their virtual card. Once verified, they'll be able to login and start using their virtual card right away!
We'll make and send their physical card. We'll do this as soon as they've submitted their ID and we've verified their account.
Activate their physical card. Once they receive their physical card, they’ll be able to activate it and set their PIN. You can view more instructions on this here.

Note: When you activate your physical card, your virtual card expiry date and CVV will change. Prior to physical card activation, the virtual card will have had different expiry and CVV. This is to prevent any unauthorised use in the off-chance it's intercepted on it's way to you. Therefore, try to avoid adding your virtual card details to any recurring payments until AFTER you've activated your physical card.
If you run into any issues with this, our customer support team is always available to help.

Finding unauthorised transactions on your card can be very unsettling, which is why we’ve put together a list of things you can do to take control of your card security and make sure you’re as protected as possible.
How to protect yourself from scams and card fraud
 
1. Freeze your card if you lose it, it’s stolen, or you notice any suspicious activity
This is the best way to make sure no further activity can take place on your card. If you aren’t able to find your card, you can cancel it permanently in your account. See instructions below on how to do each:
Freeze my card   |   Permanently cancel my card
You must permanently cancel your card if:

You’ve been a victim of fraud / a scam. If you bought something and later found that it was a scam, you have unauthorised transactions on your account that can’t be explained, or have been a victim of fraud in any way, you must cancel your card permanently. Your card details are now in the hands of someone else and are no longer safe to use. Please cancel it permanently in your account. This avoids anyone accidentally unfreezing the card in the future and your business sustaining further unauthorised transactions. 
You confirm your card has been lost / stolen. If you’ve searched and you’re unable to locate your card, you’ll need to cancel it permanently. This is the best security measure you can take against any unauthorised payments.

2. Increase your security

Avoid accessing card information on a public computer
Never write down your card details or PIN number onto a notepad, sticky note or even into a document on your computer. The only place you should be able to find those card details is by logging into your 2FA protected Airwallex account
Make sure your computer’s security software is up to date and scan for viruses regularly
Check that your WIFI networks are password protected
Avoid accessing your card information via hotspots or on public networks

If multiple people within your business have access to your virtual card details, make sure that the above applies to them too. With more flexible work arrangements becoming the norm, consider the following risky scenarios:

Hotspotting or logging into a public WIFI network to access the card whilst working on the train home / at an airport
Accessing card details off home computers, rather than work computers
Accessing card details using non-password protected WIFI at home

If you've recently experienced fraud, questions to ask yourself and colleagues are:
- Is my WIFI network password protected?
- Are other employees' home WIFI networks password protected?- Has anyone been logging into public networks (at train stations, etc)?
- Has anyone written down the card details?- Has anyone noted down the card details on their computer (Google Document, Notes, etc)?
- Has anyone written their card details in an email? This applies, even if the email is to a colleague - email inboxes are not a secure place to share details!
- Is the security software on all work laptops adequate and up to date?
- Has anyone been logging into you Airwallex account from their unsecured home computer?
3. Make sure the merchant's website is secure
You can make sure that the website you’re adding your card details to is secure by checking for the security certificates. Look out for a padlock icon in your browser bar (where your website address is listed) to show that the website is secure.
If you've recently experienced fraud, questions to ask yourself and your colleagues are:
- Have you input your card on any new website recently?
4. Pay securely
Websites can become compromised and card details taken when inputting or storing your card details on them. Two ways you can protect against this is:

Third party apps (such as Paypal). Paying using a third party provider, such as Paypal allows you to store your card details securely with them, so that you don’t have input your card details onto other websites directly.
Payment gateways. Check that a payment gateway is being used before saving your card details on a website. The use of a trustworthy payment gateway means that your card details won’t be stored on the merchant’s website, but instead will be stored within the payment gateway, which will have extra, dedicated security measures in place specifically to protect your financial details.

5. Keep your personal information protected
Make sure you have a strong password on all your devices and accounts that include upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols. Don’t use the same password for every account / device, don’t share them with others and never write them down.
This also includes shredding anything that contains sensitive information.
If you've recently experienced fraud, questions to ask yourself and your colleagues are:
- What is our procedure for disposing of sensitive documents? Do we shred them?
- Does everyone have a strong, unique password or use a secure password manager on their work computer?
- Does everyone have a strong, unique password or use a secure password manager for their Airwallex login?
- Has anyone shared their passwords, written them down, or noted them on their computer (Notes, etc)?
6. Never give anyone access to your computer
If anyone contacts you wanting to install something on your computer, no matter how legitimate it sounds, do not let them. If it’s a scam, they’ll likely be planting a virus which will give them access to all your passwords and personal information. Hang up immediately.
If you've recently experienced fraud, questions to ask yourself and your colleagues are:
- Has anyone recently had someone request access to their computer?
7. Never give your card details to anyone you don't trust
Be wary of anyone asking you for your card details. This can be via email, SMS, or phone call. You should always be provided with a secure option, such as Paypal or a secure payment gateway.
For tips how to identify a scammer and what to do if you think you’re talking to one, continue scrolling down.
If you've recently experienced fraud, questions to ask yourself and your colleagues are:
- Has anyone given their card details to someone over the phone, in an email or an SMS?
8. Be wary of unauthentic emails and pop-ups
Treat any pop-up window or notification that you’ve won something as highly suspicious. This is called “phishing”. Successful scams make their communication look very official, so it can be very difficult to identify, and often pretend to be reputable companies such as Telstra, Australia Post, Microsoft, or the Australia Tax Office.
For tips how to identify a phishing scam, scroll down to ""How will I know if I'm being contacted by a scammer?""
If you've recently experienced fraud, questions to ask yourself and your colleagues are:
- Has anyone in your company recently clicked a link in an email that might not have been genuine? (eg. a vague email from the CEO of your company, an email from 
- Has anyone clicked a pop-up recently saying they've won something?
9. If someone leaves your company, remove access immediately and cancel cards they had access to
If someone leaves your company and they had access to your Airwallex account or card(s) held by your Airwallex account, make sure to do the following immediately:

Remove them from your Airwallex account (head to the User Management section to do this)
Cancel their employee card, if they had one
If they had access to any other business cards (company cards), you must cancel them too. They may have written down the details or saved them to one of their personal devices and inadvertently use it at a later date)
Lastly, don't forget to remove their access to all company accounts, including their email, internal messaging system and anywhere else they could continue to gather sensitive information.

If you don't remove access for your ex-employees immediately, they may continue to gather sensitive information and make purchases using company money.
If you've recently experienced fraud, check through your list of users under User Management in your account to make sure you've removed all ex-employees.
10. Read our extra tips on account security
Read section 10 of our Payment and FX terms, entitled “Safety And Security”, for further tips on keeping your account safe.
https://www.airwallex.com/terms/payment-and-fx-au 
11. Keep up to date with the latest scams
Scamming comes in all shapes and sizes. You can keep up to date with the latest alerts by checking the ACCC’s Scamwatch website, and can even subscribe to receive alerts!
https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/news-alerts/browse-news-alerts 
What if I've had fraud on multiple cards?
Seeing unauthorised transactions on multiple of your cards indicates that the person responsible has access to your Airwallex account.
Do the following immediately:
1. Check that no one has access they shouldn't.
Check your list of users in User Management and remove anyone who shouldn't be there, for eg. ex-employees.
2. Ask every user to immediately change their Airwallex password.
They must change it to a strong password, which includes upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters. They should not have used this password anywhere else and they must not write it down.
3. Think about other ways your account could be accessed.
Do you have a bookkeeper or contractor? How do they keep your details safe?
How will I know if I’m being contacted by a scammer?
Red flags that you’re talking to a scammer:

They get agitated that you’re going to call the company’s general support line
They ask you for your card details
They’re contacting you at an unusual time (outside of business hours / on the weekend)
They aren’t able to give you a succinct explanation of what they’re calling / emailing about
They refuse to send you an email confirming the details of the call and their request
They’re pushing you to make payment now
They ask for remote access to your computer
They’re emailing from an Outlook, Hotmail or Gmail email address
The email address is different (even just slightly) from the email address on other emails you’ve received from this company
 

What to do if you think you’re talking to a scammer.

Don’t click any links (if by email / SMS)
Verify who they are:

- Ask for the name and job title of the person who’s contacted you
- Find an official phone number for the company (for eg. from Google)
- Call their official* support line and ask for them


Type the phone number / email address that contacted you into Google. You might find that “scam!” is the top hit.
Hang up on them (if you’re on the phone)

*DO NOT use any contact details they give you. Always find the company’s contact information via an independent source, such as Google or their official website.
Never call the number given to you by the person on the phone, or on SMS.
If the person you’re talking to gets agitated when you say you’ll call their office back and pushes you to give them your details then and there (for example, saying that you’ll lose the prize if you don’t enter them now), do not do it. This is most likely a scam.
If you think your card details have become compromised.
If you’ve noticed unauthorised transactions on your account, please freeze your card immediately and follow the steps in the following article: How do I dispute a transaction?

How to understand and reconcile your Online Payments Fees 
","
This article will help you understand your Airwallex Online Payment fees and how to reconcile them back to your payments received.
What is the settlement timing of my revenue and fees?
Every Online Payments customer will have an agreed settlement timing that is determined based on your risk and reserve requirements from Airwallex, and can also vary by payment method.
This settlement timing determines when your revenue, net of fees, will be available in your Airwallex wallet balance. For the majority of your card transactions, they will settle within your agreed settlement timing.
The two options for settlement timing are:
1. Delayed settlement of T + N: Payments that happen on Day 1, will settle by Day N (excludes weekends and public holidays)
For example, if you have a T + 5 delayed settlement. Payments that happen on Day 1, will settle by Day 6, less the payment fees.
2. Rolling reserve with T + 3 and X% reserve hold: Payments that happen on Day 1, will settle by Day 3 less your nominated reserve hold (excludes weekends and public holidays)
For example, if you have a 10% for 30 days rolling reserve. Payments that happen on Day 1, will settle by Day 4, less payment fees and the 10% reserve.
For more information about reserves: What is a reserve, why do I have one, and how much is it?
 
What are all the fees charged on each transaction?
See our fee schedule for full information on your fees.



Fee
Settlement Timing
How it works


Gateway and 3DS fee

T + N when your payment settles
T + 3 for failed payments


This fee is charged for each payment attempt as it incurs a fee from the payment scheme, including on failed transactions.
This is incurred in the transaction currency (e.g. for a USD transaction, fees will be charged in USD)



Payment method fee
T + N when your payment settles

This fee is based on the payment method used by your customer, see here for the full list of payment methods.
Incurred as a percentage on the transaction amount and currency.



Foreign currency conversion or settlement fee
T + N when your payment settles

This fee is based on your transaction and settlement currency.
Incurred as a percentage on the transaction amount and currency.



GST
At the end of the month for all Online Payment transactions
See here for more information: How is GST charged for Online Payment transactions?



 
Example #1: T + 5 settlement timing with an AUD 100 payment
Day 1: AUD 100 payment is made by your customer              - Payment can be seen in your Payments dashboard as ‘pending’Day 6: AUD 98.05 will settle and be available in your Airwallex wallet, less the AUD0.30 gateway fee and the AUD1.65 payment method fee
Example #2: Rolling reserve of 10% for 30 days for an AUD 100 paymentDay 1: AUD 100 payment is made by your customer              - Payment can be seen in your Payments dashboard as ‘pending’Day 4: AUD 88.05 will settle and be available in your Airwallex wallet              - AUD100 less the AUD0.30 gateway fee, AUD1.65 payment method fee and the AUD10 reserve hold              - Reserve hold can be seen in your ‘Wallet’ as a reserve balanceDay 34: AUD 10 reserve hold will settle and be available in your Airwallex wallet
 
How do I see all the fees I’m being charged?
There are five ways to understand your fees:
1) To understand the fees for individual payments, you can see this under the ‘Payment Activity’ section of your WebApp
Click into the payment

Navigate to the ‘Settlement’ section to see a breakdown of the fees. These fees exclude GST. See #4 for the GST component of your fees.

 
2) To understand the fees associated on a batch of payments, you can view a summary amount, fees and download a report
Under ‘Wallet’ and ‘Transactions’, you will see all the pending and settled amounts

You can find a detailed summary of the total amount, fees and the option to download a report

If you click “Download settlement report”, you will be able to receive a zip file containing both the overall settlement report and detailed fee report

In the settlement report, you can find the payment method fee, card interchange and scheme fee(if applicable) being netted from each single payment revenue, and you can also find the summary of the rest of the fees displayed in the Fee row


You can then find the breakdown of Fee row in the fee report

 
3) To reconcile your fees in Xero, your Xero Online Payments feed will separate out each transaction, revenue and fees associated

 
4) To view your GST incurred for the given period, you can find this in your monthly Invoice under ‘Account’ and ‘Statements’

 
5) To view a complete summary of all fees in a given period, you can export a custom settlement report that outlines the transaction and settlement amount, currency, FX rate and related fees.
You can also use the ‘payment attempt ID’ field to reconcile this back to your Payment Activity export.

I have questions about refunding my customers with Online Payments
","
What is a refund? 
For various business reasons you may wish to process a refund for a customer for whom you have processed a payment. This may include reasons such as errors in processing orders, shipped to the wrong address etc. You can either provide a partial or full refund withdrawn from the available balance of the settlement currency: 

Like For Like Example: USD transaction settled in USD -> refunded to customer in USD from your USD balance
Non Like For Like Example: INR transaction settled in AUD -> refunded to customer in INR from your AUD balance using the current spot rate. 

It is important for merchants to have a robust refund policy in order to avoid potential disputes. 
How do I initiate a refund? 
Merchants can initiate a refund please follow the below steps: 

Use the Airwallex API or WebApp to create a refund against a specific Payment Intent (or Payment Attempt if you require so). You can perform a full or partial refund; if you make a partial refund several refunds can occur until the principal is fulfilled. If your refund request fails to be processed, please make sure you have enough unsettled funds or available balance for refund.
You will be immediately informed that the refund request has been received and is being processed.
You will be notified when the refund has succeeded through our asynchronous notifications.

You can find more information here.
Refunds will come out of a merchant’s ‘refundable funds’ which consists of unsettled online payments funds and the available balance in your wallet.
How can I view the refunds I've processed? 
Navigate to ‘Wallet’. Once there you can export from your settlement report for each settlement for full details on all refunds.
How long will it take to process a refund?
Refunds typically take 1-2 business days in order to be processed. 
Fees for processing a refund
There is a $0.15 fee per refund (from the 8th September this fee will increase to $0.30) that you process plus any network charges (e.g scheme or interchange charges). Fees will be applied before settlement, otherwise they will be taken from reserve funds.

My incoming deposit is missing

If you're waiting for an incoming deposit and it has been more than three days since it was sent, feel free to contact us using the support form.Please include the following information to help us find it:

The date the deposit was sent.
Payment Remittance/Advice or an MT103.
The Global Account details that it was sent to.

By providing this information, you'll be helping us find your deposit and credit your Airwallex account sooner.
Why is my incoming deposit delayed?
We understand that it can be frustrating to wait for an incoming deposit to settle into your account. Unfortunately we won't have any insight until a deposit reaches our direct banking partner for a given deposit, however here are several reasons why it might be taking longer than anticipated for a deposit to settle into your Wallet.
- Hours of Operation: not all banks are active 24/7, and it could be that your incoming deposit has been delayed by bank closures over the weekend or public/national holidays. If the cut-off time for dispatch/receiving has been breached, this could also add an extra business day to the flight time.
- SWIFT Routing: Incoming deposits via SWIFT transfer can sometimes take longer than expected to arrive if they are routed through several intermediary banks. By providing our customer support team with an MT103 for incoming deposits of this type, this can help expedite the process.
- Potential Mistakes: If a mistake was made with the receiving banking details or capabilities, it can cause an incoming deposit to be delayed, and it will likely be bounced back to the sender. Our various Global Accounts can only receive certain currencies and transfer methods, which you can double-check via the Dashboard when you view your Global Account details. 
Direct debit deposits
Our direct debit deposits will settle in your account according to the following timeframes:
- If made before 4pm - 2 business days- If made after 4pm - 3 business days
Unfortunately, there is no way of speeding them up, as these timeframes are set by the bank. So if your deposit is still within these timeframes, please be patient and your deposit will arrive soon.
If your deposit still hasn't settled in your account by close of business on the 3rd day, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team.

Why did my card payment fail?
","
We're sorry to hear that your payment failed! Here are the most common reasons this might happen.
Virtual or physical cards
1. Amount exceeded limits on the card
Your card will have a spending limit on individual transactions, and also limits on how much you can spend per day/week/month. Any transactions that exceed those limits will unfortunately fail. You can see the limits that apply to your card in your account, just beneath the card details.
2. Insufficient funds in your business' Airwallex wallet
If your card fails but you haven't exceeded any of your card limits, it may be that your business doesn't have sufficient funds in their Airwallex wallet for you to make the payment. Speak to an Admin on the account so that they can make a deposit.
3. Insufficient funds in the currency you're sending
Your payment might fail if you have insufficient funds in the currency you're trying to send. To rectify this, simply change the sending currency to the currency with which you have a sufficient balance in your Airwallex Wallet / Account. This transfer will now include a conversion from that currency, into the currency your recipient needs to receive.
For example, if you're trying to send $40 AUD from your Wallet / Account to a customer who needs to receive in AUD, but you only have $100 USD in your wallet, the transfer will fail due to insufficient funds in AUD. You'll need to change the sending currency to USD. Your recipient will still receive AUD, as long as this is listed under the receiving currency.
Physical cards
1. Physical card isn't activated yet
If you try to use your physical card before activating it, it will fail. This will happen, even if you've been successfully using the virtual counterpart. Head to your account, click the banner encouraging you to activate your physical card, and follow the prompts to get it set up.
2. Physical card has been activated, but virtual card details have changed
When you first order your physical card, the virtual card attached will have a different CVV and expiry date. This is an added security measure that we’ve put in place to protect the funds in your wallet, just in case your physical card is intercepted or lost on it’s way to you.
As soon as you receive and activate your physical card, the CVV and expiry date on your virtual card will change to become the same as your physical card.
This means that, if you've saved your virtual card details anywhere before activating your physical card, you'll need to update them so that payments continue to go through successfully.
Online card payment (3DS verification)
If you're being asked to submit a 3DS verification code and:

you aren't receiving the code - see this article.
you're submitting the code but it's incorrect - see this article.
you're submitting the code and the transaction is failing - please read the ""Virtual or physical cards"" section of this article to see if any of these reasons may apply.

If you’ve tried submitting the code too many times and it’s telling you to contact support, you can get in touch with our customer support team here.
Google / Apple Pay
If your transactions are declining, you’ll be able to see ‘Declined’ in your transaction history.
You may have still seen a green tick and ‘Done’ on your screen - this just means that your device has passed the payment details to the terminal, not that the payment went through. Don’t worry, you won't have been charged!
If your transactions are declining, it could be due to the fund limit on your card, or a lack of funds in your business’ Airwallex account. See above under “Virtual or physical cards” for more details.
If you don’t believe it to be either of those issues, you can contact our customer support team, who will be able to investigate further for you.

Airwallex is committed to keeping your funds safe. Airwallex is regulated and licensed where required by the various countries in which it operates, providing you with confidence that payments you make are done through a platform that is compliant. The way in which Airwallex is required by law to keep your funds safe is determined by the laws of the country in which we provide you with our services.
The Netherlands
In the Netherlands, Airwallex’s operating company, Airwallex (Netherlands) B.V.  (‘Airwallex NL ’) holds an Electronic Money Institution license issued by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank). For safeguarding to protect you, the e-money institution must have measures in place that follow rules set by De Nederlandsche Bank. As part of our EMI licence, we have put in place ‘safeguarding’ measures to protect all of our customers' funds in line with these rules
The purpose of safeguarding is to ensure that your funds are kept separate from Airwallex NL’s own funds that it uses for its business operations and are protected from the moment Airwallex NL receives the funds, until you make payout or request a redemption (withdrawal) of your balance. This means that the money that you receive into your Wallet, is fully backed by money that we hold in separate bank accounts. Moreover, in accordance with Dutch law those bank accounts are held by an independent custodian called Airwallex Netherlands Foundation (the “Foundation”), a so-called customer accounts foundation (stichting derdengelden). The Foundation is a separate and independent legal entity, ensuring that in the case of Airwallex NL’s insolvency your funds are still protected. The separately held money is only available for the purposes of giving you back your money on your request. Furthermore, this separately held money is not available to any of Airwallex’s creditors, our banks or third parties. It means that whenever you ask us to redeem (withdraw) your e-money or make a payout, that money will be available. 
You may have heard of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (depositogarantiestelsel, “DGS”)  and wonder how this differs from the safeguarding process described above. Certain authorised financial services firms (such as an authorised bank) do not have the same safeguarding obligations as firms such as Airwallex NL, but instead are required to participate in the DGS.  The DGS protects consumers together with some businesses (that meet its eligibility criteria) should a bank fail and they cannot return your money to you. The DGS acts like an insurance policy for bank accounts and pays out up to a maximum of EUR 100,000 per eligible person, per bank. Both the safeguarding regime and DGS provide different levels of protection and risk but ultimately aim to ensure your funds are protected. For the avoidance of doubt , Electronic Money Institutions like Airwallex NL do not participate in the DGS.
United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, Airwallex’s operating company, Airwallex (UK) Limited (‘Airwallex UK’)  holds an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license issued by the Financial Conduct Authority. For safeguarding to protect you, the e-money institution must have measures in place that follow rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority. As part of our EMI licence, we have put in place ‘safeguarding’ measures to protect all of our customers' funds in line with these rules.
The purpose of safeguarding is to ensure that your funds are kept separate from Airwallex UK’s own funds that it uses for its business operations and are protected from the moment Airwallex UK receives the funds, until you make payout or request a redemption (withdrawal) of your balance. This means that the money that you receive into your Wallet, is fully backed by money that we hold in separate bank accounts. The separately held money is only available for the purposes of giving you back your money on your request. Furthermore, this separately held money is not available to any of Airwallex’s creditors, our banks or third parties. It means that whenever you ask us to redeem (withdraw) your e-money or make a payout, that money will be available. 
In the unlikely event of Airwallex UK ceasing business operations or going into insolvency, liquidation or bankruptcy, your funds kept with us will be safely set aside in the safeguarding account, and you receive them back  in priority to all our other creditors.  Please do note that, however, at that time, the appointed insolvency practitioner, who will be distributing your funds back to you, may charge you a standard fee which the practitioner will deduct from the balance of your account prior to returning the funds to you. This fee is not charged by Airwallex UK
You may have heard of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) and wonder how this differs from the safeguarding process described above. Certain authorised financial services firms (such as a UK authorised bank) do not have the same safeguarding obligations as firms such as Airwallex UK, but instead are required to participate in the FSCS.  The FSCS protects consumers together with some small businesses, limited companies and charities (that meet its eligibility criteria) should a bank fail and they cannot return your money to you. The FSCS acts like an insurance policy for bank accounts and pays out up to a maximum of £85,000 per eligible person, per bank, building society or credit union or up to £170,000 for joint accounts. Both the safeguarding regime and FSCS provide different levels of protection and risk but ultimately aim to ensure your funds are protected. As Airwallex UK is not a bank and is not covered by the FSCS, in the event of our insolvency, you will not be eligible for the protection under the FSCS.
We are available to discuss this further if you have any questions or if you would like to find out more please contact our Support Team here. More information about using a non-bank payment service provider (such as Airwallex) and the protections they offer can be found on the FCA’s website at https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/using-payment-service-providers

Changing your business address/trading name is an easy process with Airwallex.
Depending on whether you are a sole trader or a company, we may need relevant documents to verify the address before updating our system.
If your business is a Sole Trader or Sole Proprietorship:
Contact our customer support team with your query along with relevant documents such as a utility bill or a bank statement, which will help the team verify the new business or trading name.
If your business is a Company:

How to manage disputes and chargebacks on your Online Payments
","
If you use Airwallex Cards and have a transaction you wish to dispute, please see here: How do I dispute a transaction?

What is a Dispute? 
A dispute is where a cardholder will challenge a transaction on their account with a merchant. At this stage you as the merchant have the choice to either accept or to challenge the dispute. Note that in this case you are strongly advised to provide evidence and there is no guarantee that you will win the dispute. A dispute being raised will result in a chargeback or funds being reversed from your merchant account.
Note that there are strict timelines with regards to disputes that you will need to adhere to. 
General Statement on Disputes and Chargebacks
At Airwallex we know that disputed transactions and chargebacks are a risk to your business and can be a time consuming exercise to manage. Subsequently, we have implemented several mechanisms to assist you in preventing and managing disputes and chargebacks.
Dispute Management Dashboard
To assist you with timely and effective dispute management, Airwallex has created the ‘Dispute Management Dashboard’ which you can view in the webapp - see ‘Payment Acceptance Section’. 
There are two tabs. 

Response Queue: This is where you can see all disputes awaiting action. Note that there is an expiry date which needs to be adhered to. It is sorted for you by expiry date to help you prioritise disputes. Note that you have several options View Details, Accept Dispute, Submit Evidence.
All Disputes: This allows you to see all dispute history including those which are won, lost and need a response. You can also see what stage a dispute is at. 

What are the stages of a dispute? 
There are a number of stages that a dispute will go through as listed below: 

Dispute Raised by Cardholder: A cardholder will dispute a transaction with you as the merchant through their bank (the issuing bank). 
Merchant Decision: This is the stage that you as the merchant can decide to either accept or defend the dispute. 

Accept the Dispute: You accept the dispute. 
Defend the Dispute: In this case, click the ‘submit evidence’ button and choose the dispute reason and ‘type of product’. Though it is optional, it is highly recommended that you submit evidence. Examples of evidence are provided in the next section. It is important to note that once you submit the evidence, it is not possible to change evidence. This will change the status of the dispute to ‘Under Review’

Dispute Challenge Process: If you have chosen to challenge the dispute, a review will be conducted by the issuing bank. The case will be closed either in your favour as the merchant or the issuer may require more evidence. 
Arbitration: This is where the scheme will review the transaction and make a ruling. 

It is important to note that it can be expensive to challenge a chargeback. The following is where you can be charged. See ‘Are there fees associated with disputes?’ for more information.
What evidence do I need to submit for a dispute? 
It is optional, however strongly encouraged for you as a merchant to submit evidence if you challenge a disputed transaction from a cardholder. Some of the evidence you may choose to submit include: 

Proof of Delivery
Description of Goods or Services
Invoice/receipt
Customer Communication
Proof Showing Distinct Payments

How do I calculate my chargeback ratio?
Chargeback ratio is often defined as the number of chargeback requests, divided by the number of successfully captured intents over a given time period.
To calculate your chargeback ratio you will need to calculate:

The number of successful payment intents for the specified period - you can calculate this by downloading your payment activity for your specified period, and using the ‘payment status’ field
The number of chargebacks - you can calculate this number by exporting your dispute activity under ‘Disputes’ > ‘All disputes’ into a report and filter for disputes in “Dispute” or “Arbitration” stage

Please note:> It may take up to 30 days for a cardholder to challenge a transaction before it will show as a ‘disputed’ payment> For determining the fee of a specific chargeback, Airwallex will calculate your chargeback ratio for each card scheme separately (e.g. your chargeback ratio for MasterCard transactions vs. Visa transactions)
How can I monitor my dispute history?
Airwallex empowers our customers to review your dispute history. To do this, ‘Dispute Management Dashboard’ which you can view in the Webapp - see ‘Payment Acceptance Section’ and navigate to ‘All Disputes’.
From here you can view your dispute history and filter based on certain criteria. We also enable you to export disputes from Airboard. 
How Can I Reduce Disputes/Chargebacks?
There are several ways that you reduce the number of disputes: 

Integrate Airwallex with external dispute resolution tools like Visa’s Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) to resolve disputes with automated dispute resolution rules before they become chargebacks.
Respond to all RFIs in a timely manner as these may turn into disputes.
Help customers recognise their transactions by using the descriptor field to remind them of the goods or services they have purchased.
If you are refunding a transaction to prevent a potential dispute, we recommend you to use Airwallex’s refund process which ensures that funds are refunded to the same card or payment method used for the original payment.
Respond to all disputes within the requisite time frame (you can do this through ‘Dispute Management Dashboard’ which you can view in the Airwallex WebApp - see ‘Payment Acceptance Section’).
Ensure that your customers were presented with a full copy of policies/terms and conditions prior to customer purchase.
Use the risk management settings to minimise fraudulent transactions. Using the ‘View Details’ on the ‘Dispute Management Dashboard’ you can also see the geolocation of the device, billing and shipping address to help you determine if a dispute is likely to be fraud.

Are there fees associated with disputes?
Yes there are fees per dispute. See the relevant fee schedule for your region for full information on the pricing:

Hong Kong Fee Schedule

What is a reserve, why do I have one, and how much is it?
","
What is a reserve? 
A reserve is a temporary hold on a certain portion of a merchant’s transactions. The reserve calculation occurs on a daily basis prior to any Airwallex fees and is applied only after settlement. 
Why is there a reserve on my account? 
A reserve amount is an established industry underwriting practice to preserve the integrity and operation of Payment Acceptance. The reserve amount will assist in streamlining and reducing any issues created by the risks of online payments such as credit risk, refunds and chargebacks. 
What are the types of reserve?
Airwallex has two types of reserves that merchants can choose from:

Rolling 30 day reserves: Take a percentage of a transaction for a 30 day period. (e.g. on a $100 transaction, $10 is held for 30 days and returned to the customer after 30 days). Note that the exact percentage and period will depend on a variety of risk based factors.
Delayed settlement: Net transaction amount is held for a number of days before being settled with the merchant.

Can I remove the reserve? 
Airwallex continually monitors the level of merchant risk to determine if we can lower/remove the reserve level. However, you can take steps to limit a reserve which include: 

Providing a financial report of the last 2 years (audited preferred, for both the onboarding entity or its parent company) can be accepted, including incoming statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement
Providing a sample invoice or contract with your refund policy

How can I find out how much reserve is being held? 
Airwallex provides you with the transparency and visibility of the fees and reserves held or returned. To view this information navigate to your wallet and click on a specific currency. You will see the account balance and the reserved balance as well.
How can I have the reserve amount revised?
To have your reserve balance revised, please contact your account manager or our customer support team.

https://help.airwallex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4406116998297-What-is-Airwallex-s-risk-engine-,"
What is Airwallex's risk engine?
","
What is Airwallex’s risk engine? 
Airwallex’s risk engine empowers you to detect fraudulent payments from legitimate ones and allows you to take relevant action. Our risk engine uses internal models in conjunction with external datasets. 
Our risk engine provides you with a risk score. The risk score is the probability of the specific transaction being fraudulent. For example a risk score of 30 means that there is a 30% chance of the transaction being fraudulent.
We give you the flexibility to set your own risk appetite, when 3DS should be enabled or whether a transaction should be rejected. We also give you the power to manually review transactions. 
How do I configure the various risk thresholds?
In the webapp, navigate to the ‘Thresholds’ section. There you will find a slider which is a visual representation of your risk appetite. Note that 3DS (3 Domain Secure) is an additional layer of security that customers will have to go through to make a payment. This adds friction to the customer journey, but may also reduce the risk of fraud and may shift the liability of fraudulent transactions to the issuing bank. 
Use the green slider to set those transactions which you would like to allow without 3DS. 
Use the red slider to determine how many transactions you wish to reject without the use of 3DS. Those transactions with a score in the red zone will be rejected. 
Those transactions in the yellow zone will require either 3DS or a manual review.  
Are there exceptions to the risk engine? 
As a merchant, you will always know your business the best. As such we empower you to leverage our fraud and risk management capabilities. We offer you several ways to create rules and exemptions to the risk engine to manage your risk accordingly. Be aware that this may impact your fraud and chargeback rates; be also aware it can help to improve your authorisation rate in some specific cases.

Bypass List: Allows you to create a rule which will automatically bypass the risk engine and accept the transaction. As a precaution, we recommend you use the Alert List (c) rather than the Bypass List.
Reject List: Allows you to automatically reject transactions which have passed the risk engine. Note that you will not have an option to accept this transaction further.
Alert List: Any transaction on the Alert List will follow the alert review criteria ((either use 3D Secure, recommended, or trigger a manual review).

I have questions about PCI - DSS
","
What is PCI - DSS?
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI - DSS) sets out the requirements for merchants to safely and secure handle card payments. This is critical to protect privacy and prevent fraud and data breaches. It aims to provide protection on the sensitive information throughout the lifecycle of a card transaction (from card acceptance to payment processing). 
PCI compliance is a result of the formation of the PCI Security Council and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard which was implemented by the five major card schemes - VISA, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and JCB. These standards help ensure that there are consistent global standards to cardholder protections. 
For information about the PCI - DSS standards you can visit: pcisecuritystandards.org 
 
PCI - DSS levels of compliance obligations
To begin to understand your level of PCI - DSS compliance that you must abide by, firstly determine which ‘Level’ of Compliance you fall under using the below. Note that below is based on the most recent 52 week period.




PCI DSS Level


Description




Level 1


Merchants processing over 6 million VISA or Mastercard transactions annually.
OR
Global merchants identified as Level 1 in any VISA or Mastercard region.




Level 2


Merchants processing between 1 million and 6 million VISA or Mastercard transactions annually across all channels. 




Level 3


Merchants processing between 20,000 and 1 million Visa or Mastercard e-commerce transactions annually. 




Level 4


Merchants processing less than 20,000 Visa or Mastercard e-commerce transactions and other merchants processing up to 1 million VISA or Mastercard transactions annually.




Source: Visa PCI DSS Compliance
 
Who needs to be PCI - DSS compliant? 
Any merchant who accepts payment cards (credit or debit) and/or transmits cardholder information must be PCI compliant and follow the necessary requirements. The requirements to be complied with will depend on a variety of factors including the nature of the organisation and the number and size of transactions.
Airwallex customers who have the Online Payments product will need to ensure that they are compliant with the relevant PCI - DSS compliance requirements. You can use the below as a guide.




PCI - DSS Compliance Levels


Level 2

Level 3
Level 4

Submit and Attestation of Compliance (AOC) form.
Conduct a quarterly scan by an Approved Scan Vendor (ASV).

I need to become PCI DSS compliant. How do I become PCI DSS compliant?
If you have determined that you need to comply with PCI - DSS compliance, Airwallex can guide you in terms of the process.
If you've completed the PSS - DCI form within the last 12 months, you can provide this to Airwallex.
Use the previous table to understand what forms you need to fill in. You can download the files below.
- SAQ A - Word Doc
- SAQ A-EP - Word Doc
- Attestation of Compliance

Word Doc - AOC for SAQ A
Word Doc - AOC for SAQ A-EP
As the merchant, you are required to complete the forms. 

As the merchant, you will send the complete forms to your Airwallex account manager or contact our customer support team.
If you do not provide the relevant information or do not satisfy the relevant PCI - DSS compliance requirements, Airwallex may choose to not provide/suspend payment services.
What happens if I am not PCI - DSS compliant?
Card schemes determine ‘Non-compliance’ and can impose significant fines. Fines can double each quarter you do not remediate your PCI - DSS non-compliance. For those customers who are in the EU, a PCI DSS breach is also a GDPR breach as cardholder information is personal data.

What is the name on my card?
Depending on whether you're creating a company card or employee card, the card in question will have a different cardholder name.
 
Company card
A company card will always bear the name of your business as the card name.

Employee card
When setting up a user as a new cardholder for the first time, you'll be able to select the name that appears on their card.

If unsure, you can always look up the individual card details in the Cards section of the WebApp to see the name affiliated with the employee card - both for physical and virtual cards.

Card Billing Address
The billing address linked to a given card is simply the physical address of your business, as we have it on file. Even if you've had a physical card shipped to a specific residential address, the affiliated card billing address will still be the business' physical address.

When can I send my transfer?

You can create a transfer whenever you'd like in your account. However, when the transfer is sent is dependent on the processing times of different banks, usually within the local business hours. 
Transfers may not be processed until the next day due to being booked outside of business hours, including weekends or not public holidays. 
If you make a transfer, it will show as 'Processing' in your account until it is processed at the next available time. Once the transfer has been sent, the status will change to 'Sent'.
- What is the ""transfer date""?- What happens if the transfer date is a holiday for the currency of your recipient?- What happens when the transfer date is not specified?- Which timezone is my transfer date in?

What is the ""transfer date""?
When making a transfer in the web app, you'll be asked to input a ""transfer date"".
The transfer date is the day we send the money to your recipient, not the day they receive it. Your recipient should get the money within the processing time, usually 3-5 business days from the transfer date.

What happens if the transfer date is a holiday for the currency of your recipient?
If the date you choose for us to send your transfer falls on a holiday or non-business day for your recipient’s currency, then we’ll send the money on the next business day.
Please note, because our partners are located in different time zones across the globe, transfers may also be impacted by regional holidays in the countries you are sending to and from. 

What happens when the transfer date is not specified?
The transfer date will be set to the default transfer date, which is the earliest available date we can start processing your transfer.
For most customers, the default transfer date is the current date. The transfer date is also impacted by the available settlement date when you fund a transfer with a different currency.

Which timezone is my transfer date in?
The location of the Airwallex entity you registered your account with, will determine your account time zone.

What are foreign currency fees on my Airwallex Online Payments?
","
There are two types of foreign currency fees that can be charged on the relevant transactions, applicable to both card and local payment methods (e.g. WeChat Pay).
What are the types of foreign currency fees?
These two fees are mutually exclusive, so you will only be charged for either:1. a foreign currency settlement fee, or2. a foreign currency conversion fee
When are these fees incurred?
These fees are also determined by your home currency, the transaction currency and the settlement currency.
1. Local currency: The currency based on your account region and location
> Australia = AUD
> United Kingdom = GBP
> Europe = EUR
> Hong Kong = HKD
> Singapore = SGD
2. Transaction currency: This is what your customers see, transact and pay in at the checkout (e.g. on Payment Links, WooCommerce checkout or on custom-built checkout flows)
3. Settlement currency: This is the currency that will settle into your Airwallex wallet
> Where like-for-like is supported, this will be the same as the transacting currency
> Where like-for-like is not supported, the transaction will be converted into your nominated settlement currency (by default this is the same as your local currency)



Description
When does this apply


Foreign currency settlement fee
On non-local currency transactions, with like-for-like settlement


Foreign currency conversion fee
On non-local currency transactions, where like-for-like settlement is not supported and requires a currency conversion to settle into your nominated settlement currency



 
Can I change my nominated settlement currency?
Yes. You can change your default settlement currency by emailing support@airwallex.com, to the top major currencies of USD, GBP, EUR, HKD or AUD.
What currencies can I settle like-for-like?

Can I pay via Direct Debit from my Global Account?
","
At this point in time, only our USD Global Accounts support Direct Debit Payouts. This is enabled by default for US customers. For customers in other regions who wish to payout USD via Direct Debit, please contact our Support team here.
When will other currencies be enabled for Direct Debit from my Global Account?
We understand that this is a critical functionality for many of our customers, and our teams are currently hard at work to enable Direct Debit payouts across all our Global Accounts and with support for more currencies. 
In the meantime, join our waitlist to be the first to know once this feature is available on your account.
What if I need to issue a refund via my Global Account linked to a payment gateway / e-commerce store?
Most platforms will attempt to initiate refund transactions via Direct Debit if there is no immediate balance available, which may cause delays if the transaction is declined. 
In order to avoid this, we encourage all of our customers to maintain sufficient funds on their eCommerce platform or Payment Gateway in case any potential refund transactions need to be processed.
If you have a non-USD Global Account linked to an account that falls into this category, please know that payment gateway / e-commerce stores will be unable to initiate refund transactions via Direct Debit.

How to withdraw money from your Wallet
","
 
Withdrawing funds from your Wallet is easy!
In short, withdrawing money from your Wallet is done much the same as creating any transfer to a given recipient. The difference is that in this case you are the recipient and you'll be initiating a transfer to the bank account affiliated with your business.
 
To do so, simply navigate to the Wallet section of the WebApp, where you'll see the option to ""Send Money."" 
(Alternatively, you can also initiate this process from the Transfers section)

 
Assuming this is your first time withdrawing funds from your Wallet, you'll want to send the transfer to ""Someone New.""

 
First things first, you'll choose which Wallet currency to withdraw funds from and you'll want to enter the country and receiving currency of your business' bank account. There is NO withdrawal fee, but select transfer methods may incur a fee charged by our banking partner (eg. SWIFT, FedWire), and if there is a currency conversion involved the standard conversion fees will apply.

 
Next up, you'll need to select the transfer date and purpose of transfer. We conveniently have ""Transfer to own account"" listed as an option for you here!

 
Following this, the next step will prompt you to enter the affiliated banking details and business details of yourself, the recipient. Once you fill that information out, you'll be able to review the withdrawal as you've set it up. If everything looks good, just go ahead and click ""Create"" and you should see the funds land in your bank account shortly! You'll also have the option of saving your bank details as a ""Contact"" so that you won't have to fill out the banking/business information in the future. Next time you do this, you'll simply want to pick an ""Existing Recipient.""

 
If you run into any issues along the way, please don't hesitate to get in touch with our customer support team.

","
Company cards are good for business purchases that are typically made online and on behalf of the entire company or specific teams and departments. This could include purchases such as software subscriptions, office supplies, supplier payments, and marketing expenses. Company cards are currently only available as a virtual card. As an admin, you will be able to access card details for company cards.
 
Employee cards are great for individual employee purchases either made online or in person. This could include travel expenses like airfare or hotels and incidental purchases like coffee or snacks. Employee cards are available in physical card format, and cardholders can also add their employee cards to their digital wallet for easy, contactless purchasing. As an admin, you will not be able to access card details for employee cards. Only the cardholder will be able to access their card details.

How is GST charged for Online Payments transactions?
","
What is GST?
Goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia.
See here for further information about how GST works in Australia.
 
Why am I being charged GST?
All of our Online Payment fees are quoted to be GST-inclusive. 
GST-inclusive means that on our 1.65% + AUD0.30 rates mentioned, 10% of that covers the GST requirement.
GST is charged separately at the end of the month. Non-GST transaction fees are charged on each transaction in real-time, providing you and your business with better cash flow.
 
How much am I being charged, and how do I work this out?
GST is calculated as 10% of your total Airwallex Online Payment fees for that given period. 
To find out your total Airwallex Online Payment fees:
 

Navigate to ‘Reports’ on the sidebar



Generate a Settlement Report for all currencies for the specified period



You will receive a Fee Report in each settlement currency that summarises your total fees (in that settlement currency)


The GST amount is calculated on these fees in the settlement currency, collected from your wallet balance at the end of the month.
 You will see this GST amount represented in your nominated local currency (e.g. AUD for Australian customers) on your statement.

If you’re not receiving your verification code, please try the following:
1. Select a different method to receive the code
If you have both an email address and phone number on your Airwallex account, you’ll have the choice to receive your verification code to either of them. If you aren’t receiving the code to one of them, request the code to be sent to the other.
2. Check if your email address / phone number is the same as the ones stored in Airwallex
Login to your Airwallex account and check the email address / phone number you have on file. These are the details we’ll use to send your verification code. If you need to update your details, you can do so in your account. If you have any trouble with this, click here for instructions.
3. If you chose email, is it in your junk folder?
Make sure to check your junk or spam folder!
4. Do you have a VPN installed on your phone?
If so, it might be blocking the SMS from coming through. Try disconnecting your VPN, requesting the verification code again and see if it comes through. If that still doesn’t work, try receiving your code via email instead.
5. Are you overseas?
If you’re overseas and unable to receive text messages, please choose to receive your code via email. If you also don’t have access to your email account either, unfortunately you’ll need to make this payment using a different card.

Sometimes copy and pasting may carry over spaces - try typing in the code manually instead.
2. Ensure you’re inputting the most recently received code
Every time you request a code, the previous code expires. If you’ve requested the code multiple times, make sure you’re inputting the code you were sent most recently, as it should be the one that is valid.
If you input your verification code incorrectly 3 times in a row, your card will be temporarily blocked by Visa. If this happens, please get in touch with our customer support team, who would be happy to help. Get in touch with them here.

Why have transactions gone through, even after my card has been frozen / cancelled?
","
 
When you freeze/cancel one of your Airwallex cards, this will prevent any and all future transactions made on this card from going through.
 
However, if you have any card transactions in PENDING status when you freeze/cancel said card, you may still see these transactions go through. This is because a card transaction in PENDING has already been approved by Airwallex and is now waiting for the merchant to authorize said payment, which they have 7 business days to do. If the merchant approves one of these transactions, it will go through even though your card has been deactivated, as the transaction no longer sits with Airwallex.
 
If you suspect any of transactions, that can no longer be cancelled, to be fraudulent, please don't hesitate to file a transaction dispute with us.

How long should it take for my recipient to receive their funds?

Once your transfer has been sent, you typically can expect it to arrive within 3 to 5 business days. The exact timeframe is dependent on a variety factors including the selected payment method, the recipient bank's location and the transfer date. 
Please review our Payout Guide to see what payment methods are available and how long they should take to arrive. Generally we find that, where available, local transfers are faster than SWIFT. However, if you haven't used a local method to pay the recipient before, we recommend confirming with them before sending your first transfer.
Further delays may be due to national or banking holidays, requests for supporting documents or due to incorrect account information. 
If you are concerned that your transfer still hasn't arrived after the expected time, please reach out to our Support team.

Please read our guide below to find the answers to all your transfer notification questions. 
- How does Airwallex notify me about a transfer? - How does Airwallex notify my recipients?- How do I set up notifications for my transfer?- If I have multiple team members that need to be notified, what can I do? 
How does Airwallex notify me about a transfer? 
We’ll send you notifications through emails about the following activities:

We’ll send you an email when we send out your transfer. Note that this does not mean that the transfer has reached the recipient yet.
We will notify you about the conversion created with the transfer only if your fund deduction mode has been configured to post-fund.
You will receive an email when if there is a problem with your transfer. So it is important to make sure you keep an eye on that when you set up a transfer. The failure reason is explained in the email, and you need to reply to the email within 3 business days (90 business days if you are a Hong Kong customer) to retry your transfer with updated transfer information or cancel your transfer directly. We will cancel your transfer if we don’t hear from you. The refund will be credited back to your wallet upon cancellation.
We currently do not notify you about a canceled transfer.

Note that the emails will be sent to the business primary contact email address in the account settings. If you haven’t received any email after creating a transfer, check your spam folder in case it’s been sent there. 
Get in touch with our support team if you have questions.
How does Airwallex notify my recipients?
If you would like your recipients to get notified, you can contact our support team to set it up for your account(s). When this notification is enabled, an email will be sent to the email address in the recipient’s details, so remember to add an email address for your recipient when you make a transfer. 
How do I set up notifications for my transfer?
The setting is currently not available in the Airwallex Web App, and you will need to contact our support team to set it up for your account(s).
If I have multiple team members that need to be notified, what can I do? 
You will need to contact our support team to add more email addresses to receive email notifications about the transfer activities.

How to create a batch transfer using ABA files
","
You can now pay your employees and suppliers on Airwallex via a batch transfer using ABA (Australian Banking Association) files exported from your accounting software. Please note that ABA Batch Transfers are currently only able to be paid out in AUD.
You can make as many transfers on an ABA file as you'd like. There are no limits to the number of transfers supported per ABA file.
Transfers processed via ABA files will follow our usual processing times that you can see in our Payout Guide. 
If you would like to create an international batch transfer please refer to the guide here.  
1. Setting up before generating an ABA file
The 'From account'Airwallex can accept ABA files with the 'from account' (an account from which funds are debited from) specified as any bank account as Airwallex deducts the funds from your Wallet and does not need to rely on this information. For better reconciliation, you may want to set up the bank account you wish to fund the batch payment or pay run in the accounting software. In this case, you can enter your default AUD Global Account bank details accordingly in the BSB and Account number fields.
Direct Entry service numberWhen asked for the Direct Entry service number (sometimes also known as an APCA Number, DE user ID, BECS ID or BUDS ID, APCA number), simply use 000000.
Self-balancing transactionYou do not need to include a self-balancing transaction. If your ABA file includes the self-balancing transaction, it will not be processed.
For more details, please see the ABA file format specifications at the bottom of this page.
2. Generate ABA Files
Note the ""Description of entries"" and ""Date to be sent"" in the ""Descriptive record"" will be used to generate your batch transfer.
See the ABA file format specifications table below for the field specification and how Airwallex will use the information in an ABA file.
3. Log in to Airwallex, navigate to Transfers > Batch Transfers, and start by clicking on New ABA batch transfer

4. Upload your ABA file
Please note, the only file format supported is .aba and the maximum number of transfers that can be accepted per batch is 3000. 

5. Update transfer date when it's expired
When your ABA file has an expired transfer date, you can update the date when reviewing the batch transfer.

6. Fix any transfers that fail to process
When there are other types of errors in the file, you can  re-generate the ABA file from your accounting software (after correcting the errors in your accounting software) and click Cancel and restart to re-upload your file. Common errors include: - Incorrect BSB format: please ensure there is a hyphen, e.g., 000-000- Transfer date: this needs to be in the format DDMMYY, and cannot be a date in the past

7. Review and create your batch transfer
You can view the total amount in the Batch Summary, and individual transfers in the Transfer details section.


Once reviewed, click Create to book the transfers.
If your account does not have transfer approval enabled, you can create the batch right away.
If your account has transfer approval enabled, the creator can submit the batch transfer for approval. The approver can then review and approve it in the Approval list.
See here to learn more about transfer approval.

 
8. View a created batch transfer
Once a batch transfer is created, you can view it in the Summary list. Transfers get booked after a batch transfer is created. A 'Booked' status of batch transfer indicates that all transfers within the batch are successfully created. For large-sized batch transfers, it takes longer to create all transfers. The transfer status can be tracked in the batch details.
Once a transfer is booked, the funds are deducted from the wallet immediately. If you have requested to set the fund deduction mode to be 'post-fund', the funds are deducted from your wallet on the transfer date.
The transfers are sent to the recipients on the transfer date specified in the ABA file.

How to set up multiple accounts under the same entity
","
Please refer to this quick video for a step-by-step guide: 

Frequently Asked Questions
 
What is a legal entity?
A legal entity is the business entity registered with your local jurisdiction. Legal entities are typically assigned a unique registration number (e.g. ABN in Australia, CRN in China and Hong Kong).
Do I have to go through additional KYC for a new account created under the same entity?
New accounts created under an existing legal entity will be immediately activated and ready to transact (you no longer have to submit KYC information for these accounts!).
Note, you will need to submit some supplementary materials to access our payment acceptance product for any new accounts created - please follow the instructions listed here.
Can I move an existing account to a different legal entity?
No, existing accounts cannot be moved to another legal entity.
Can I set up a new account under a new legal entity?
Yes, you can. You can create a new account by specifying a new legal entity via the Account Switcher interface on the Webapp and following the prompts to submit the relevant documents required to activate the account.
Is there a limit to the number of accounts that can be created under one legal entity?
There is no limit to the number of accounts you can create under the same legal entity.
Who can create a new account under an existing legal entity?
Only an ‘Account Owner’ can create a new account under an existing entity. User roles can be viewed under the User Management section on your Airwallex account. 
Will accounts created by different users display on a common account switcher?
Each account created is independent and will not aggregate to a common account switcher view by default. If you would like access to an account created by another user, please contact the user to provide you with access.
Are accounts created under a legal entity separate from each other?
Yes, each account is separate. This means who has access to one account will not have access to the other accounts under that legal entity unless an admin has given them permission.
Can I transfer the funds across these accounts I create under one legal entity?
Yes, you can create an Account Group of the accounts you own under the legal entity. Then you can easily transfer the funds across the accounts within the group via the Aggregate funds feature. Learn more about Account Group.

How do I set up the Xero Expense Data integration?
","
To set up the Xero Expense Data integration, navigate to the Connections page.

Select the Xero Expense Data tile to open the Xero Expense Data home page. Click the connect button in the top right.

Note: In order to configure the Xero Expense Data integration, it is required that you first enable the Xero Bank Feed integration. See here for steps on how to connect to Xero Bank Feed.You will only be able to import your expense accounts and the tax rates that can be applied to those expense accounts.  At this time we don’t support importing tracking categories with over 1000 category options.
Once Xero Bank Feed is connected:
You will see the following page where you can select your Xero organisation. Make sure that the Xero organisation you select is the same for both Xero Expense Data and Xero Bank Feed.

Once you’ve selected your Xero organisation, you can review and connect the relevant currencies that you expect to incur expenses in. If you have already connected Xero Bank Feed, your existing bank feed currencies will already display as connected.
After reviewing and updating your currency connections if needed, you can then review and edit the expense data that you want to import into Airwallex. This includes your chart of accounts (expense accounts), your tracking categories, contacts and your tax rates. You can choose to import all or a subset of the data. For contacts, you can choose to opt in to displaying imported contacts for your cardholders to use when submitting expenses. 


Once you’ve successfully imported your expense data, you can customise which fields you want your employees to submit for their expenses in Expense Settings.


What if I don't want to use tracking categories or tax rates?
If you do not want to import your tracking categories or tax rates from Xero, you can unselect all values on the import page. If you do so, that field will no longer show up in Settings or on the expense details pages.

*This feature is currently only available for Australia and United States based accounts. If you would like to request this feature and get early access for your account, let us know here.
To make it easier for you to top-up funds to your Airwallex wallet, you can link your Australian or United States bank accounts to Airwallex. This allows you to withdraw funds from your other bank accounts into Airwallex via direct debit all within the Airwallex platform. Linking new accounts is currently only supported on Web
Once linked, an AUD direct debit can be initiated through both the Web app or via our iOS mobile app. For now, USD direct debit top-up is only supported on the Web app, while support for iOS mobile app is coming soon.
Note: Direct debits can only be initiated by approved users on your account. Airwallex will never initiate direct debits without your knowledge. Funds typically take 2 - 4 business days to be deposited into your Airwallex wallet via direct debit. All accounts also have a preset daily limit. To raise this limit, you can contact our Support Team here. 
> Link your Australian Bank Account> Link your United States Bank Account> Set User Permissions for initiating direct debits
For more information on Direct Debit timeframes see articles below:> How long does it take to funds to my Airwallex Wallet via direct debit? > Why was my wallet top up via direct debit cancelled?
Link your Australian Bank Account
1. Click on “Add funds” on your Dashboard or Wallet tab
2. Select “AUD” as the currency
3. Click on “Direct debit from Linked Bank Account”

4. Select the bank account owner from the dropdown menu, which includes the UBOs and individuals associated with your account that you have provided to Airwallex during onboarding.
Please note that you may amend the bank account name so that it matches exactly against the account name recorded at your financial institution (i.e. from ABC Inc. to ABC Ltd.). However, it must still be owned by your selected bank account owner.

5. To verify your Linked Bank Account, check your external bank account for the 2 micro-deposit amounts, which are expected to arrive within 2 business days. Look out for “Airwallex” in the payer name. When you’ve received the micro-deposit, you may go back (either via the reminder displayed on your Dashboard, or by going to Account → Settings → Linked Bank Accounts) to input the micro-deposit amounts and complete verification.

After successfully verifying and creating an active Linked Bank Account, you can now use direct debit to add funds on Web or iOS!

The Airwallex/Zapier integration was disconnected. You can find out if the app disconnected on the zap page on Zapier
The trigger was filtered out. Ie if you set up a filter to not trigger for transactions below $200, you would not receive a notification

If you continue to experience issues, please report errors directly to Zapier and their customer support team will be in touch.
I've received an Error Message, what does it mean?

- Regulated Markets   - Collecting Funds in a Regulated Market   - Transfers- How can I provide order information for IDR Local collections?- Can I reuse order information for deposits and transfers quota?- Why are my IDR funds being auto-converted into USD?
Regulated Markets
We call regions with strict foreign exchange controls ""regulated markets"". These are places where to remain compliant with local regulations, you need to provide order information (e.g., invoices of imports or exports) before collecting or transferring funds.
Throughout the process, Airwallex aims to shield you from regulatory complexity, so you can focus on what matters most. We guide you through what to submit, how to submit it, and what to expect at every step.
Collecting Funds in a Regulated Market
Collecting funds in a regulated market is not all different from the deposit experience you are used to. You still open a global business bank account, record your global account details (or provide them to a customer), and complete a bank transfer to add funds when you are ready.
Spotlight: Collecting IDR in Indonesia

The key differences come in the extra steps you need to take before funds settle in your account. Let’s take IDR collections as an example (depicted above). 
To start, you must upload additional documents before collecting any IDR. Authorities in regulated markets like Indonesia want to first understand why you are collecting local currency.
We call these additional documents ""sales orders"", or invoices of the goods or services you sold in the regulated market (in the example above, Indonesia). Once you upload your ""sales orders"", we verify them instantly and calculate the total value of the sales you made. That total becomes your ""deposits quota"", or the maximum amount you can collect of that regulated market currency (in the example above, IDR).
Essentially, to collect funds in a regulated market, you must submit details on what you imported and we use that information to make sure you remain compliant with local regulations.
You must submit sales orders before making deposits. If your deposit arrives and it exceeds your deposits quota, your deposit will be rejected and returned to the sender. 
Transfers
Transferring funds into a regulated market is also unique. You will be required to upload order information as well, this time of the goods or services you bought from the regulated market. Once verified, your orders add together to provide you ""transfers quota"", or the maximum amount you can transfer in that particular regulated market currency. 
Like the deposit experience we described above, you will not be able to execute a transfer to a regulated market that exceeds your transfers quota. Always be sure to upload order information ahead of time.
Questions?If you need an explainer or refresher on orders and quotas, check out our section on those for deposits and transfers.
 
How can I provide order information for IDR Local collections?
If you are interested in collecting IDR and moving it out of Indonesia, regulators require you to provide order information for goods or services you imported into Indonesia. We call this order information ""sales orders"".
Submitting Sales Orders for Collecting funds in Indonesia:

Sales orders track details like the prices, dates, and descriptions of what you imported. We ask you to submit this information in a standardized excel file format. 
Curious what exactly a sales order should look like? Before you submit your sales orders for the first time, we provide you with an excel template (examples below) that guides you through what information is needed. 
This is how the information will look once you submit it:

The second tab of the excel template provides you instructions on how to fill it out:

Once you upload your files, we verify them instantly. If all goes well, you get a ""deposits quota"", or the maximum IDR you can collect locally. We calculate your deposits quota by adding up the values of the column reporting the sale value of each good or service.
If you want to see how much IDR deposits quota you have, head to ""Account"" -> ""Declaration Center"" -> ""Deposits declaration"". Here, you will be able to view your existing quota and upload more sales orders.

Note, your deposits quota is assigned on a currency level. Meaning, you can use it to make deposits across multiple Indonesia global accounts.
Please note, when you open a global business bank account in Indonesia, recall that this account will not accept international deposits. Incoming transactions should be made via the RTGS or SKN local payment networks. Cross-border transactions or ATM payments will be rejected. 
 
Can I reuse order information for deposits and transfers quota?
If your company is based in a regulated market and you collect funds locally from another regulated market, you may only need to upload order information once. 
Submitting Sales Orders from Indonesia to Transfer funds into another regulated market:

If you exported a good or service from a regulated market and directly sent it into another regulated market, then your records on what you imported are identical to your records on what you exported. Your sales orders, in other words, justify both your deposits and your transfers.
In cases where this applies, you can upload your sales orders and immediately get two quotas: (1) deposits quota for the regulated market you imported into and (2) transfers quota for the regulated market you exported from.
Note, only select customers are eligible to reuse their sales orders for both quota. If any of the following describe you or the things you are selling, then you are not eligible for reusing orders:
- You are based outside of the regulated market you seek to transfer funds to- Your goods/services were not exported from the regulated market you seek to transfer funds to- Your goods/services were not imported into the regulated market you seek to collect funds from
 
Why are my IDR funds being auto-converted into USD?
Certain regulated markets, like Indonesia, compel foreign account holders to move their local funds offshore in a timely manner. Meaning, if you collect IDR, you cannot leave it parked in your Indonesia global bank account for too long.
To ensure your funds are safe and you remain compliant with local standards, we auto-convert your IDR into USD as soon as your deposits settle in your wallet. 
Once converted, your funds can be used freely like any other available USD wallet balance. Our intention is to minimize the time between you collecting funds and being able to use them–anywhere in the world.

This guide will walk you through how to set up and configure Expenses as an Admin. You can also check out our other guides Expense roles and permissions and Approving expenses.
How do I configure my expense settings?
To configure your expense settings, follow the steps below.
Step 1: Navigate to the Expenses page

Step 2: Click Settings
Once on the settings page, you will be able to do the following:- Manage your Xero Expense Data connection
- Configure a start date for processing expenses in your account
- Set expense fields as required for submission
- Deactivate the Expenses product in your account

Step 3: Configure a start date for processing expenses 
By default, the start date for processing expenses is set to two weeks prior to the date you activated Expenses for your account. All expenses incurred prior to this date will automatically be archived, with the exception of expenses currently in review, approved, or synced. 
This start date can easily be adjusted to any date up to your current date. Adjusting the start date will also dynamically adjust which expenses are archived or restored to ensure that only expenses prior to the start date remain archived.

Step 4: Set expenses fields as required for submission
By default, Airwallex provides three fields: Receipt, Merchant, Notes. If you have already imported your expense data from Xero (see our guide here for how to set up the Xero integration), those fields will surface here in addition to the default Airwallex fields.
For each field, you can specify whether you would like that field to be required or optional for expense submissions. For receipts, you can configure the amount threshold above which you’d like to require receipts. 

Note: If you set up the Xero integration to enable expense syncing to Xero, the chart of accounts field will always be required for expense submissions. See here for more information on the Xero Expenses Integration. 
If you’re not connected to Xero, will you be able to create your own expense categories?
Creating your own expense categories for expenses is not currently supported.
Are there limits to file size, number of files, or file type that can be uploaded as receipts for an expense?
The maximum number of files that can be attached is 10. Each file must be no larger than 10 MB.
Supported file types are: bmp, csv, doc, docx, jpeg, jpg, pdf, png, tif, tiff, xls, xlsx

Step 2: Select an individual expense to review and approve
To review the expense submission details, click into the expense. When ready to approve, click “Approve expense”, or alternatively if there are errors that you would like the cardholder to correct, click “Request resubmission”. 
Pending transactions will appear but cannot be approved until the transaction has cleared. 

 
Can an admin approve their own expenses?
Yes. Admins can approve their own expenses directly without having to submit for review.
Please note, submitted expenses that are still pending cannot be approved until the transaction has successfully been processed.

What is the Xero Integration for Expenses?
","
This guide will provide an overview of your Expenses integration with Xero. For more information, please check out other articles on Expenses and Xero. 
What is the difference between Xero Bank Feed and Xero Expense Data?
While related, the Xero Bank Feed and Xero Expense Data integrations are slightly different. 
The Xero Bank Feed integration enables you to automatically sync all your Airwallex wallet transactions to Xero on an hourly basis. 

The Xero Expense Data integration is an add-on to the Xero Bank Feed integration. It enables you to:

import your expense information (e.g., chart of accounts, tracking categories etc) from Xero into Airwallex and;
sync expenses and receipts back to Xero for reconciliation against the bank feed. 

Importing information like your chart of accounts into Airwallex allows you to delegate tasks like expense categorisation and receipt upload to your cardholders. They’ll be able to log in to Airwallex to categorise expenses and upload receipts. When the expense syncs to Xero, it will sync with all the relevant expense information and receipts. 

How do tax codes tie into Expenses?
Admins can configure the Xero integration to import the relevant tax types for their business. Expenses can then be classified by expense users according to whichever tax type is relevant for that expense (e.g. GST, VAT).
If the admin chooses to not import any tax categories when importing the chart of accounts, as the expense flows through to Xero (once the employee has chosen the Chart of Accounts GL code) Xero will assign the default tax code configured in Xero for that specific GL code.
What happens after an expense is approved?
Once an expense is approved, it will automatically begin the syncing process to Xero. The expense will be synced to Xero as a bank transaction and will include the following information:
- Transaction details- Attached receipts (if any)- Merchant selection (if any)- Expense category selection (chart of account)- Tracking category selection (if any)- Tax rate selection (if any)- Notes (if any)
To check the status of the expense sync to Xero, refresh the page. If the expense status is “Synced”, then the expense has completed syncing to Xero. If the expense status is “Sync failed”, then there was an issue that prevented the expense from syncing to Xero.


Two important notes: -When syncing expenses to Xero, if the expense is assigned to an existing Xero contact, the expense will be synced to the selected contact. If a new merchant value is entered that is not an existing Xero contact, the expense will sync to a default “Airwallex Expenses” contact.- Individual notes synced to Xero will be displayed at the bottom of the bank transaction, under History & Notes.
How do I reconcile expenses in Xero?

How do merchants tie in to Expenses?
Admins can choose to allow their cardholders to assign expenses directly to Xero contacts. On the Xero Expense Data page in Connections, admins can toggle on the Contacts tile to start displaying imported contacts to their cardholders. (see here for detailed guide).

How to set up the Xero Expense Data Integration
","
This guide steps you through how to set up your Xero Expenses integration. For more information and help, please check out other articles on Expenses and Xero. 
How do I set up the Xero Expense Data integration?
You can watch our video walkthrough demo on how to set up Xero Expense Data, otherwise, see below for a step-by-step guide. 

To set up the Xero Expense Data integration, navigate to the Connections page.

Select the Xero Expense Data tile to open the Xero Expense Data home page. Click the connect button in the top right.

You will see the following pages where you can select your Xero organisation. Make sure that the Xero organisation you select is the same for both Xero Expense Data and Xero Bank Feed.


Once you’ve selected your Xero organisation, you can review and connect the relevant currencies that you expect to incur expenses. If you don’t yet have Xero Bank Feed connected, you can connect your currencies.


If you have already connected Xero Bank Feed, your existing bank feed currencies will already display as connected.

After reviewing and updating your currency connections if needed, you can then review and edit the expense data that you want to import into Airwallex. This includes your chart of accounts (expense accounts), your tracking categories, your tax rates, and your contacts. You can choose to import all or a subset of the data. For contacts, you can choose to opt in to displaying imported contacts for your cardholders to use when submitting expenses.


Once you’ve successfully imported your expense data, you can customise which fields you want your employees to submit for their expenses in Expense Settings.


Important notes:
- In order to configure the Xero Expense Data integration, it is required that you first enable the Xero Bank Feed integration.- You will only be able to import your expense accounts and the tax rates that can be applied to those expense accounts. - At this time we don’t support importing tracking categories with over 1000 category options, and we don’t support importing Xero contacts from accounts with over 10K contacts.
How do tax rates tie into Expenses?
If the admin chooses to not import any tax rates from Xero, when the expense syncs to Xero, Xero will assign the default tax rate configured for the expense’s assigned chart of account.

Expenses Pricing
","
Employee Card Pricing 
You will be charged monthly for each active employee card, which gives you access to our Expenses product.  If you want a detailed breakdown of your Employee Card and Expenses fees click here. 
When will I get billed?
Each billing cycle will align to the calendar month. On the 2nd day of each calendar month, you will receive an invoice for your usage for the prior calendar month. The amount listed on your invoice will automatically be debited from your Airwallex account 14 days after you receive an invoice, on the 16th of the month.
How will I get billed?
14 days from the invoice date, the amount listed on your invoice will automatically be debited from your Airwallex account.
What if I activate a cardholder halfway through the month?
You will only get billed for the parts of the month that you have an active cardholder. If a cardholder becomes inactive during the month, you will no longer be billed for that cardholder for the remainder of the cycle.
Can I still see my expenses for company cards?
Expenses for Company Cards will be visible to, and can be managed by, administrators
Note: when Card Manager goes live, they will also be able to see Company Card Expenses. 
What does an ‘active’ cardholder mean?
An active cardholder is a cardholder that is verified and has one or more cards (either in use or frozen). To be an inactive cardholder, no cards have been issued, or all cards have been cancelled or have expired.
What happens if I issue multiple cards to the same cardholder?
We bill you monthly for the number of active cardholders you have. Each cardholder can be issued an unlimited number of cards (subject to limitations set out in Airwallex’s Acceptable Use Policy).
What happens if a cardholder stops being ‘active’ part of the way through a cycle?
If a cardholder becomes inactive during the cycle, you will no longer be billed for that cardholder for the remainder of the cycle.

To deactivate Expenses on your account, navigate to the Settings page. At the bottom of Settings, you will see the option to turn off Expenses. If you choose to deactivate, Expenses will be hidden from your account for all admins and cardholders. 

Important notes
After you deactivate Expenses on your account, your Xero Expense Data integration, if previously connected, will continue to stay active and your settings will be maintained in case you’d like to reactivate Expenses at a later point. During this time, however, no user in the account will be able to access Expenses to edit, submit, approve or sync expenses to Xero.

How do I update my Xero Expense Data integration?
","
This guide will provide an overview of how you can update or make changes to Xero Expense Data integration.For more information, please check out other articles on Expenses and Xero. 
If you’d like to update the expense data (e.g., chart of accounts, tracking categories, contacts and tax rates) imported from Xero into Airwallex, you can do so on the Xero Expense Data homepage in Connections. Navigate to the main Connections page and select the Xero Expense Data tile.

This page displays the data that you had previously imported from Xero for your chart of accounts, tracking categories, tax rates and contacts. 

If you’ve made any changes in Xero, we recommend that you refresh your Xero data in Airwallex by clicking “Refresh data” to ensure your expense data continues to sync successfully to Xero. Refreshing your data in Airwallex will ensure that your expense data in Airwallex remains consistent with your expense data in Xero. 
If you’ve added a new chart of accounts, tracking categories, tax rates or contacts in Xero, they will now show up in Airwallex. If you’ve archived any existing chart of accounts, tracking categories, contacts or tax rates in Xero, they will be removed from Airwallex. And if you’ve renamed any chart of accounts, tracking categories, contacts or tax rates in Xero, their new names will be reflected in Airwallex as well.
For each of the expense data types (excluding contacts), you can click “Edit selection” to update which values you’d like to surface to your employees when they’re submitting their expenses.

Important note: Refreshing your Xero data in Airwallex is particularly important if you’ve archived any tracking categories or tax rates in Xero. Currently, if you approve and sync an expense to Xero with an archived tracking category or tax rate selected, the expense will still successfully sync to Xero. The tracking category field will be left blank and the tax rate field will have the default tax rate configured for the selected account.

Using Airwallex Expenses with Accounting Software

Airwallex Expenses can be integrated with Xero (see here), but what if you use Accounting software other than Xero? Are you interested in using our Cards/Expenses solution?
Not to worry, our team is building out integrations to Quickbooks and NetSuite. Join the waitlist here or request any other accounting software. 
Without an accounting software connected, you can still use Airwallex Expenses to:

Give your employees an Airwallex employee card so they’re never out of pocket on a large business expense
Collect, store and track receipts for each transaction for future audit purposes
Export all card transactions to manually reconcile in your accounting software

However, you will not be able to categorise expenses as this requires an integration to your Chart of Accounts.
Here’s how you can get started:

Set up cards for your various employees. Please refer to the following guide for step by step instructions on How to set up your employee with an Airwallex card
Turn on Expenses in the Expenses tab on the left hand panel of your WebApp.
Educate your employees on the cards and expenses. Please refer to the following guide on How to submit an expense to guide your employees to submit their receipts and information on their card transactions. 
As card transactions begin to take place, you can export a report from the “Reports” tab in your WebApp titled “Balance Activity Report” 



To generate the Balance Activity Report, you select your date range, choose transaction type and finally, file format (CSV or Excel)
You can export the report on a weekly or monthly basis (frequency of your choice) 




Once downloaded, you will need to move the transaction details over to a file format dictated by your chosen accounting software and the updated file can be uploaded into your accounting software.
Once transactions have been uploaded, you can download the attached receipts via the transactions in the Expenses tab and attach them to the appropriate transactions within your accounting software

Are notifications available for Expenses?
","
Yes! Real-time notifications are sent after successful transactions on Employee Cards with a prompt to submit the expense, and daily reminder email and mobile push notifications are sent to cardholders for new expenses incurred that day, and to administrators for new expenses awaiting their review.
For example, if a cardholder makes 5 purchases on a given day, they will receive a notification at the end of the day reminding them to submit those 5 expenses. If the cardholder makes another 2 purchases the following day, they will receive another notification at the end of that day reminding them to submit those 2 expenses.
You can go to Notifications in the ‘Profile’ section of your account (on Web or Mobile) to opt out of notifications.

How to pay this tax?
When you make transfers to the above countries, local financial institutions collect this tax automatically with each transfer created using Airwallex. You can choose to cover the tax yourself, or pass it to the recipient, just as what you can do with a transfer fee. 
How is this tax calculated?
The tax amount is calculated by multiplying the tax rate with the amount you enter when you create a transfer. If you are using the Airwallex batch transfer, the tax rate is applied on the source amount or payment amount you enter in the template. 
Example 1
You enter 1,000 BRL as the amount the recipient gets and you select USD as the currency you send. Given the tax rate in Brazil is 0.38%, the tax amount is 3.8 BRL (1,000 * 0.38%). Airwallex then converts 3.8 BRL to the USD amount using the foreign exchange rate at the time. 
Example 2
You enter 1,000 USD as the amount you send and select BRL as the currency recipient gets. Given the tax rate in Brazil is 0.38%, the tax amount is 3.8 USD (1,000*0.38%).

> Can I settle ‘like-for-like’ in multiple currencies that I’m receiving payments in?> Will I be able to settle in multiple currencies where I don’t have a local entity set up for that country?> Can I get like-for-like settlements for multiple non-domestic currencies, 1 for each unique store under the same Shopify Plus account? > If I use Shopify Payments for cards, along with multi-currency pricing offered by Shopify for alternate payment method transactions processed by Airwallex
 
What is the difference between store currency, transacting currency and settlement currency?
Store currency: This is the ‘home’ currency that defaults to the location of your store (e.g. AUD for AU stores, USD for US stores). Shopify currently supports 1 store currency for each store.
Transacting currency: This is the currency that your shopper sees at the checkout when they pay for. This can be different to your display currency (e.g. browsing your store in their local currency USD, though during checkout the customer would be shown AUD and pay in AUD).
Settlement currency: Also referred to as payout currency, this is the currency that you receive your payouts (or net revenue) from Airwallex or from Shopify in.
Can I settle ‘like-for-like’ in multiple currencies that I’m receiving payments in?
With Airwallex, we can settle ‘like-for-like’ in 7+ currencies, where your funds will settle into your wallet in the currency your customers paid you in. No more unnecessary conversions.For example, for an Australian business which operates a Shopify store with USD store currency, when their customer checks out on the store website and pays in USD, the business can receive their settlement in USD.To enable this on your store, you will need to ensure your Shopify store is set up to accept payments in that currency by:

Setting your Shopify store currency to the currency you want to settle in, see here for Shopify’s guide (Note, Shopify typically allows only one store currency per store, not multiple)
Ensure your Shopify website and checkout is configured to accept multiple currencies at checkout, see Shopify’s guide on how to accept multiple currencies at checkout
Ensure the payment method offered via Airwallex supports that transaction and settlement currency, see all supported payment methods and your options for the settlement currency here

To understand the fees associated with like-for-like, multi-currency settlements, see the Fee Schedule here.
Will I be able to settle in multiple currencies where I don’t have a local entity set up for that country?
Yes. If you have configured Shopify's store currency and checkout currency to a supported settlement currency, you will be able to accept and settle in that currency.
Can I settle in multiple currencies for a single Shopify store?
Despite Airwallex supporting like-for-like settlement in 7+ currencies, Shopify currently supports 1 store currency for each unique store which restricts the supported settlement currency for each store.
You are able to create additional stores for the different store currencies and regions you would like to support (e.g. one store for USD, one store for EUR, etc.), and integrate your Airwallex Online Payments into each store to support multi-currency settlement in your Airwallex account.
If I use Shopify Payments for cards, along with multi-currency pricing offered by Shopify for alternate payment method transactions processed by Airwallex:
> What will be the transaction currency (currency paid by the buyer)?> What will be the settlement currency?> What FX fees will be applied, and who will bear these?
Multi-currency pricing over Shopify, automatically converts store currency and prices to the Shopper's domestic currency. In all such cases, the store currency will be the transacting currency.
As long as your store currency is a supported transacting currency, your buyers will be able to see alternate payment methods. You can also select the settlement currency for the respective payment method as long as it is supported by the alternate payment method as a settlement currency option.
For example, a HK business with a Shopify store with HKD as store currency, can offer Dana as an alternate payment method on their store website, since HKD is allowed as a processing currency with two settlement currency options available (HKD or USD).
Where the transaction currency and the settlement currency are not the same, we may charge you an FX conversion fee as applicable.
See all supported payment methods, transacting and settlement currencies here.

How to reconcile your Airwallex Xero Invoice Payments
","
This guide explains how your Airwallex Xero Invoice Payments will reconcile to your Xero account. Please see below for: 
- How the settlement process works- How to reconcile your settlement amount to your invoices
How the settlement process works
When you create an Invoice in Xero and select Airwallex as the payment service, we will create a checkout link that your customers can use to pay the Invoice. When your customers pay the Invoice, the payment amount will be posted to the Invoice and the ""AWX - CUR Invoices"" account in Xero where CUR is the currency of the invoice (e.g. HKD, AUD, EUR, THB). 

For more information about how settlement works for your Airwallex account, see this article: I have questions about the settlement of funds using Online Payments
How to reconcile your settlement amount to your invoices
The Airwallex Xero Bank Feed that posts all your wallet transactions to Xero will include a Batch Settlement line item for this settlement, alongside any payouts, deposits, or FX transactions you made. 
You will see this under the ""Airwallex CUR"" Xero bank account where CUR is the currency of the wallet balance. 
You can reconcile the transactions posted in ""AWX - CUR Invoices"" against the Batch Settlement by downloading the Settlement Report from your Airwallex webapp and seeing which payments are included in the Batch Settlement, and the breakdown of fees and payment reserve holds. 
This report allows you to match the Batch ID with:
- Gross settlement amount and currency- Fees - payment method fees, gateway fees, etc.- Reserve amount- Exchange rate- Net settlement amount- Order ID

Coming soon: Better settlement accounting feeds
In order to help you more easily reconcile your online payments activity, we are currently working on an improved Online Payments Accounting Feed.
Get early access by signing up here
The Online Payments Feed will post line items for each online payment transaction, its underlying fees, and any settlements deposited into your wallet balance. You will see accounts named ""AWX Online Payments - CUR"" in Xero where CUR represents the settlement currency.
To reconcile your transactions after this feature launches:

You can reconcile the Invoice Payment in ""AWX - CUR Invoices"" against a corresponding transaction amount in ""AWX Online Payments - CUR"". Note that if your Invoice Payment was in a non-like-for-like currency (e.g. THB), you will need to reconcile it against the settlement currency (e.g. AUD). 
You can reconcile any transaction fees (e.g. payment method fees, gateway fees) into a Bank Fees account.
You can reconcile the Batch Settlement line item in the Bank Feed against the settlement line item in the Online Payments Feed.
Any remaining balance in the ""AWX Online Payments - CUR"" account represents amounts held as a payment reserve per your payment reserve plan.

How it works


Cardholder subscription / Expenses subscription 
This fee is based on the number of cardholders that were active for the duration of the billing cycle. 
Please see the fee schedules by region on our website to review the fee charged per active cardholder for your account.


Count
This unit represents the number of # of active cardholders you will be charged for.
We bill you monthly for the number of active cardholders you have. If a cardholder becomes inactive during the cycle, you will no longer be billed for that cardholder for the remainder of the cycle. See here on definitions of active and inactive cardholder.


Fee
This is the total fee you will be charged based on how many active cardholders you had during the month (excl. GST/VAT).
This is based on the  ‘Count’ item on your statement, and the price you pay per active cardholder.



 
How do I see the fees I’m being charged?
You are able to view your invoice in one of two ways. Please note only account owners/ admins will be able to view invoices
Option 1: Via the webapp   1. Please navigate to the ‘Account’ tab in the left navigation bar on your webapp   2. Click on ‘Statements’

How can I assign expenses directly to Xero contacts? 
","
Admins can choose to allow their cardholders to assign expenses directly to Xero contacts / merchants. On the Xero Expense Data page in Connections, admins can toggle on the Contacts tile to start displaying imported contacts to their cardholders. 

Once enabled, as cardholders fill out the merchant field on an expense, they are able to search and select from existing Xero contacts or enter in a new merchant value.

If the expense is assigned to an existing Xero contact as the merchant, when synced to Xero, the expense will automatically be synced to the selected contact. If the expense is assigned a new merchant value that is not an existing Xero contact, the expense will sync to Xero under the default “Airwallex Expenses” contact.

Note: At this time, we only support assigning expenses directly to Xero contacts for accounts with no more than 10K Xero contacts. For accounts exceeding this limit, Xero contacts will not be imported into Airwallex and expenses cannot be assigned directly to a Xero contact.

How do I pass on fees or apply a surcharge on a customer payment?
","
A surcharge rate is a fixed percentage that will be added to the total transaction amount so you can pass on your processing fees to your payers. 
Surcharge rates are currently available on Airwallex Payment Links and Xero Invoice Payments. This is not supported for shopping platform integrations (e.g. WooCommerce, Shopify).
You can set a surcharge rate for all your cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.), Apple Pay, and Google Pay payment methods. Surcharging is not supported on other alternative payment products or payment methods at this time. 
You can set up and manage your surcharge rates in the Webapp > “Payments” tab > “Settings” > “Surcharge rate” section. 
To set up surcharge rates, first select which payment product you would like to enable surcharges on, then set a fixed rate for all your cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay transactions. 
Once set, when a payer tries to pay with a card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay, their total transaction amount will be increased to reflect the additional fee.

You can download your settlement report to check our past month’s average card processing fee when setting a surcharge, or refer to your regional pricing (AU HK SG). Your average card processing fee varies based on the mix of domestic, international payments and any foreign currency fees charged.
Disclaimer: This feature is only available to businesses based in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In Australia, there are laws prohibiting excessive surcharging. It is your responsibility to comply with local laws and regulations around surcharging.

How to understand and reduce failed payments
","
There are a variety of reasons why your customers’ payments may have failed or been declined. Airwallex aims to protect your business from fraudulent payments, while minimising the loss of declined payments that are legitimate payments. Minimising fraudulent payments is important to avoid loss of revenue, time and fees with handling disputes and risk of suspension from payment schemes if your payments are deemed high risk.
We are continually looking for ways to improve our payment success rates with machine learning, experimentation, issuer and network outreach.
This article will help you:> Understand the top payment decline reasons > How to identify the reason on a specific payment> Steps you can take to reduce payments being declined going forward
Why has my payment failed or been declined?
There are four key reasons why a payment could fail:

Payment blocked by Airwallex risk engine given a high risk score
Payment blocked due to your configured risk rules and lists
Payment expired because the customer didn’t complete or fails 3DS authentication
Payment declined by the customers’ issuing bank due to insufficient funds, high risk score or other reasons

A payment’s risk and likelihood to be accepted by issuing bank is also influenced by:> The nature of your business (e.g. industry, location)> The transaction details (e.g. timing, amount, frequency)> Your customer (e.g. sufficient funds, location, device used)
International, cross-border card payments are likely to see lower success rates as issuing banks deem this as higher risk.
To understand what the decline or fail reasons are for a given payment, you can do so by:


Within the WebApp: Under ‘Payments’ > ‘Payment Activity’ and select a specific paymentExample 1 and 2: Payment failed because it was blocked by the Airwallex fraud and risk engine, or due to your configured risk rules and listsExample 3: Payment failed because the customer did not complete the 3DS authentication where 3DS was triggered, but the customer dropped offExample 4: Payment failed as it was declined by the issuer, with the response code of 54 Expired card or expiration date is missing


As a .xlsx report: Under ‘Payments’ > ‘Payment Activity’ you can export all the detailed payment information including response code, description, 3DS triggered, authenticated, CVC check and more



Payments blocked by Airwallex risk engine or your configured risk rules
All Airwallex Online Payments accounts will have Airwallex’s automated fraud prevention and risk engine that blocks any payments that are evaluated as high-risk. This helps your business effectively prevent fraudulent transactions, disputes and chargebacks.
The risk score indicates the probability of the specific transaction being fraudulent. For example a payment with a risk score of 30 has a higher probability of being fraudulent than a payment with a risk score of 10.
The risk score on a given payment is assessed based on Airwallex’s machine learning model that builds on:> Payments and checkout flow data> Card networks and bank partnerships> Historical Airwallex payments, device fingerprints and IP
See here for more information about Airwallex’s risk engine
Adjust your risk settings
While Airwallex strives to provide you with the information and tools needed to protect your business from fraud, you’re ultimately responsible for the payments you choose to accept, including those that are later disputed or found out to be fraudulent.
Under ‘Payments’ > ‘Risk’, you are able to configure your risk thresholds to either:> Accept: Use the green slider to determine the transactions you would like to accept without 3DS> Reject: Use the red slider to determine the risk score you would like to reject, without the use of 3DS> Alert: Use the orange slider to determine which risk score you would like to request 3DS or a manual review

Use alert or reject lists

We offer you several ways to create rules and exemptions to the risk engine to manage your risk accordingly. Be aware that this may impact your fraud and chargeback rates; be also aware it can help to improve your authorisation rate in some specific cases.
> Reject List: Allows you to automatically reject transactions which have passed the risk engine. Note that you will not have an option to accept this transaction further.> Alert List: Any transaction on the Alert List will follow the alert review criteria (either use 3D Secure, recommended, or trigger a manual review).
Payments that fail the 3DS authentication
3-Domain Secure™ (3D Secure or 3DS) authentication provides an additional layer of security by protecting you against fraud when you accept card payments online. It requires shoppers to complete a verification step with the card issuer when paying, thereby shifting the liability for fraudulent card payments from you to the issuer in case of disputes. Airwallex supports 3DS for all card schemes that you can use to accept payments, namely Mastercard (Mastercard Identity Check), Visa (Visa Secure), and UnionPay.
3DS is generally required by regulation for all payments in Europe (EEA) and may be triggered for other payments based on risk settings.
See here for more information about Airwallex’s 3DS feature.
Improve your checkout copy
In your checkout experience, let customers know they may be asked to complete 3DS verification during the checkout process. A cardholder who isn’t expecting a 3DS screen may be less likely to complete.
Adjust your 3DS trigger settings
In the same way you can adjust your risk settings under ‘Payments’ > ‘Risk’, you can adjust your ‘Accept’ and ‘Alert’ threshold to determine which risk score you would like to request 3DS or a manual review.
For example, if you’d like to trigger 3DS less, you would increase your ‘Accept’ threshold to accept payments with a higher risk score (and higher risk of being fraudulent).
Handle 3DS redirects
If you are using our Native API integration, you will need to build the flow to handle the 3DS redirects. 3DS transactions can be frictionless (without any need for challenge response) or challenged, which includes interaction with issuing banks & device data collection steps.
See here for a guide on how to handle the 3DS redirects.
Payments that are declined by your cardholder’s issuing bank
For payments that have been 3DS authenticated or skipped 3DS, they will go to the cardholder’s issuing bank to be authorised for payment. The issuing bank has automated evaluation models to decide whether to authorise the payment or not to protect the cardholder from fraud.
Review the response codes and merchant advice codes
You are able to see and review your response codes in two ways:

Within the WebApp: Under ‘Payments’ > ‘Payment Activity’ where you can select the ‘Cog’ icon to customise columns and show response code next to each payment
As a .xlsx report: Under ‘Payments’ > ‘Payment Activity’ you can export all the detailed payment information including response code, description, 3DS triggered, authenticated, CVC check and more

By understanding the top decline reasons and any patterns, you can implement specific improvements to help improve your payment success rates.
See here for the full list and description of Issuer response codes to troubleshoot your errors, and merchant advice codes for how you might retry a failed transaction.
However, it’s not always possible to know exactly why a payment was declined. Issuing banks tend to categorise many declines as generic “Do not honour”.
For privacy and security, issuing banks can only discuss the specifics of the declined payment with cardholders. If all the card information seems correct, your customer or cardholder can contact their issuing bank to ask for more information.


Request and share more checkout information
The more data you collect and share for the payments, the better will Airwallex and the issuing bank be able to assess the risk of the payment and limit declines of legitimate payments. Collecting billing addresses, email addresses etc. can help to increase your payment success rate.

Offer local payment methods and currencies
Digital wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay have higher payment success rates as it securely authenticates the payment using biometrics.
Some countries may also have local payment methods that have a higher adoption and success rate such as Bancontact in Belgium, or Kakao Pay in Korea as an e-Wallet. Success rates can also be improved by charging the customer in the right local currency (e.g. KRW for Korea instead of USD).
Note that when you do charge in a foreign currency, different to your customers’ local currency, they may incur foreign currency fees from their issuing bank.
See here for Airwallex’s full list of payment methods, transacting and settlement currencies available.
Ask for an alternative or updated payment method
If a card has failed or been declined with response codes such as ‘insufficient funds’, you can ask your customer for an updated or alternative payment method to help improve the overall success rate of your orders or invoices.
For recurring payments, use network tokenization or account updater to keep your card-on-file details updated
For businesses who store customer payment details and consent for future payments, Airwallex also provides Network Tokenization and Account Updater on most major card schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard).
This feature ensures the payment details stored are automatically updated when the card expires or is replaced to improve your payment success rate.

How long does it take to add funds to my Airwallex wallet via direct debit?
","
To make it easier for you to top-up funds to your Airwallex wallet - you can link your Australian or United States bank account to Airwallex. This allows you to withdraw funds from your other bank account into Airwallex via direct debit all within the Airwallex platform. 
How to add funds to Airwallex via direct debit 
How long does it take?
If you are issuing a direct debit from your bank account to top up the wallet, funds typically take 2 - 4 business days to become available in your wallet balance. The variance in settlement time depends on the local direct debit scheme rule and the cutoff time.
Initiating a BECS direct debit in Australia 
It usually takes 2 - 3 business days for Airwallex to confirm the fund settlement result from Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) before we can reflect the direct debit amount in your wallet. It could take up to 4 business days for the funds to arrive. 
- If you requested the direct debit on a weekday before 4:00 PM AEST, the earliest settlement time is 2 business days from the time of direct debit creation
- If you requested the direct debit on a weekday after 4:00 PM AEST, the direct debit will be initiated on the next business day. The funds could reach your wallet as soon as 2 business days after that.
- If you requested the direct debit on a weekend, the direct debit will be initiated on the following business day. The funds could reach your wallet as soon as 2 business days after that.
The below illustration shows the timeline in business days from the time (T) that a BECS direct debit is initiated from Airwallex WebApp.

Initiating an ACH direct debit in the United States 
It usually takes 2 - 3 business days for Airwallex to confirm the fund settlement result from Automated Clearing House (ACH) before we can reflect the direct debit amount in your wallet. It could take up to 4 business days for the funds to arrive. 
- If you requested the direct debit on a weekday before 9:30 AM CST, the earliest settlement time is 2 business days from the time of direct debit creation. 
- If you requested the direct debit on a weekday after 9:30 AM CST, the direct debit will be initiated on the next business day. The funds could reach your wallet as soon as 2 business days after that.
- If you requested the direct debit on a weekend, the direct debit will be initiated on the following business day. The funds could reach your wallet as soon as 2 business days after that.
The below illustration shows the timeline in business days from the time (T) that an ACH direct debit is initiated from Airwallex WebApp.

Why was my wallet top-up via direct debit cancelled?
","
Your direct debit top up might be cancelled if:
- There isn’t enough money in your Linked Account to cover the direct debit.- Your bank account does not support direct debits.- You’ve reached your direct debit limit.
First, make sure your external bank account supports direct debit. Next, check if the account balance or debit limit is enough to cover the top-up amount.
If you have confirmed the above information but still don’t understand why the deposit is cancelled, we suggest contacting your bank to get more information as they would be best placed to assist.

Configuring low balance alerts on your account can help ensure that you always have sufficient funds for your critical operating expenses. To get started, navigate to the 'Settings' tab in your Wallet. There you will find a new section on low balance alerts. 

Click “Set up” and select the currency balance, or balances, you’d like to receive alerts for. You can set one alert per currency. Enter in your low balance threshold, save, and you’re finished! Any user on the Account with the Wallet View permission will be able to opt in/out of receiving these notifications.
 
The moment your Available balance drops below the threshold, we’ll send an email to all opted-in users. Read here for details on how to opt in or out of notifications.

If there are expenses in the account that you do not want to approve and reconcile through Airwallex, you will be able to archive them as long as their status is “Incomplete” or “Resubmit needed”. Any expenses that are currently in review, approved, or synced cannot be archived.
You can archive and restore individual expenses from the expense details.

You can also archive historical expenses in bulk by configuring an Expenses start date in Settings. All “Incomplete” or “Resubmit needed” expenses incurred prior to the start date will automatically be archived.

Only admins can archive and restore expenses. However, both cardholders and admins will be able to see when an expense has been archived. Once expenses have been archived, you can filter them out of the expense tables.

How to use Global Accounts for Direct Debit Payouts
","
Airwallex Global Accounts now support direct debit payouts. You can provide your Global Account details to pay both one-time and recurring bills such as taxes or utilities. 
Today, USD Global Accounts, located in the United States, support direct debit. If your registered business location is in the US, we’ve already enabled this capability for you. If your registered business location is outside of the US, contact your Airwallex Account Manager to enable this capability.
Setting up your Global Account with direct debit enabled
Depending on when you created your last Global Account, you may need to create a new account for this capability. To get started:
1. If you have an existing Global Account, check whether it supports direct debit payouts.
Navigate to your Global Accounts in the sidebar. 

Select a Global Account, verify whether “Payout via ACH direct debit” is enabled or disabled in the “Account capabilities” section.

If your account does support direct debit payouts, it can be used today for payments!
2. If your existing Global Account does not support ACH direct debit, please contact your Airwallex Account Manager first to enable this capability. Then, follow the below steps to create a Global Account: 
From the Global Accounts section, click on Create Global Account. 
Select the desired location and currency of your Global Account, noting that only USD Global Accounts in the United States support direct debit payouts. For details on the capabilities, click the information icon next to the Global Account location.

Assign a nickname to the new Global Account.
Payout with Direct Debit
To payout via direct debit, simply share your Global Account details to the debiting party and authorize direct debit payouts against your Global Account. When a direct debit transaction request is received, Airwallex will check whether there is a sufficient balance in the Wallet. 
Airwallex will debit funds directly from your Wallet balance if there is a sufficient balance. Otherwise, your transaction will be rejected. If the payout fails, you may still be responsible for fulfilling your obligation to the debiting party.

How to Cancel Direct Debit Payouts
","
If you want to cancel or stop a recurring direct debit payout being made against your Global Account, please first contact the debiting party directly. You may have to terminate the contract or subscription with the debiting party, or set up alternative ways for future payments. We suggest you consult the debiting party about the consequences of cancelling the direct debit. 
 
If the debiting party doesn’t comply with your request, Airwallex can help you to submit a cancellation request. Please make sure you contact us as early as possible before the next payment is due.

If you notice an unauthorized direct debit of your Airwallex account, please contact our Support team immediately to request a reversal of the unauthorized transaction. Please make sure you provide us with enough details about the transaction, including the transaction amount, the date and time of the transaction, and the debiting party’s name. You can find the details on the WebApp by clicking into the direct debit transactions.

Generally, if you contact Airwallex within the timeframes set out below, we will be able to return the direct debit payout transaction via our banking partners:

If your registered business location is in the US, and you want to request a refund for USD direct debit payouts against United States Global Accounts, you must contact Airwallex within 40 hours of the transaction posting to your account. 
If your registered business location is outside of the US, and you want to request for USD direct debit payouts against United States Global Accounts, you must contact Airwallex by 10:00AM PST on the next business day after the transaction is posted to your account.

It may take a few business days for the funds to arrive in your Wallet after we receive your refund request. We will try our best to obtain a refund on your behalf, but it is not guaranteed to be successful if we receive the request beyond the set timeframes. 
If you contact Airwallex to request a refund beyond the timeframes, we may be able to submit a dispute to the relevant payment scheme. You can lodge a dispute within 2 years after the transaction is posted to your account. We may require supporting documents for investigation and you are advised to submit them at your earliest convenience. The dispute process will take some time, and during that period, the funds will not be refunded until it is resolved.

No call queues. No automated systems.Get startedSpeak with a specialistFrequently asked questionsWhat is a virtual Visa card?A virtual payment card exists digitally on your phone or computer and can be used to pay for expenses. Just like a physical card, virtual cards are linked to an account and have a unique number, as well as an expiry date and security code.How does a virtual Visa card work?Virtual Visa cards work in much the same way as a physical Visa card. You can use your virtual card to send money to another account, or pay for subscriptions and other everyday expenses. Are virtual Visa cards safe?Virtual Visa cards are safer than physical cards because there’s no risk of your card being lost or stolen. Virtual cards do not include account information, just a long number, expiry date and security code. So, it is much more difficult for fraudsters to access your business account. The account owner can create and delete virtual cards in minutes, and set spending limits on a card-by-card basis. So if a card is misused it can be cut off easily. You don't need a bank to run your businessStart winning new markets today.

Changes that would normally take decades have materialised in just a matter of months in 2021. The digital evolution is here and now - and we are at the centre. What we do today will determine our future tomorrow. We want to embrace this moment with absolute clarity on what really matters. Taking the first stepI started a specialty coffee shop with Max in 2014. We needed to purchase coffee cups and packaging overseas; nothing was easy but making international payments the traditional way was extremely manual and expensive. We decided to solve this problem by founding Airwallex with Xijing, Lucy and Ki-Lok. Jack ZhangCo-founder & CEO, AirwallexInnovationThe greatest inventions in human history did not come from mediocrity and minimal effort. At Airwallex, we started with a curious mind and an idea to build and make the world better. We were seeking the truth. In five years we have achieved things beyond our imagination, and yet we are only at the beginning. Imagine what we can achieve next!A Better FutureThe future is uncertain. Embracing uncertainty requires us to test our assumptions about the shape of the future, ask ‘what if’ questions and explore possibilities, while admitting that we don't know all the answers. We want to avoid the trap of living within the parameters of what has already been defined by others, because this is the only way to create a better future and achieve extraordinary outcomes.CustomersWithout whom our infrastructure would be of codes and rails, a solution without a problem! Our customers are why we are here - so knowing them, keeping them and consistently delivering a superior experience is the only way we can fulfill our mission.TalentWe are drawn to people who bleed obsessive curiosity and uncompromising idealism. Talents with this ‘grit’ have figured out how to make it through life without drowning in boredom and a lack of purpose. And they have learned to take on challenges, apply their own passion and make an impact in the world.Execution VelocityTo compete we need execution velocity. Technology is changing so quickly, if we don’t lead, we will never catch up. This is the reason we are impatient and intense. We have to act fast and sharp - so that we can capture opportunities, compete and be better in solving the important business problems for our customers.Share in SuccessThe company we have built is a melting pot of cultures and a tribe of mission-driven individuals working together to achieve a global vision. This strong sense of ownership goes beyond our mindset and spirit. We value everyone’s contributions and work to ensure we can share in the long term success of our company be it through financial rewards or employee share options.PurposeMore than anything, the reason we show up every day is our desire to make an impact. We have one purpose in mind - to empower businesses of all sizes to grow without borders. When we succeed, we create a better world with what we do.Our ValuesAirwallex has everything we need to be successful if we can hold ourselves accountable to the culture we build and the values we live. Above all, we have to believe in, understand and live these values each and every day.Our valuesCustomers FirstOur customers are why we are here. Knowing them, keeping them and consistently delivering a superior experience is the only way we can fulfill our mission.Intellectual HonestyWe want to constantly seek the truth, to be open, constructive and transparent, approaching every problem with data and facts, not conjecture and opinion. Obsessive CuriosityWe always start by asking why and seek to understand. We have a hunger for knowledge, seek challenges that are insatiably interesting and always consider if there are better ideas. Craftsmanship We are about product and engineering excellence. We create products and solutions with passion, finesse and meticulous attention-to-detail to deliver the best customer experience and outcome.Inspire and Be InspiredWe are a melting pot of cultures and ideas, and we recognise that happy, healthy and highly-functioning teams are inclusive and diverse. We celebrate success, share knowledge, learn and grow together.  Make ImpactThe reason we show up every day is our desire to make an impact and create a better world with what we do.
